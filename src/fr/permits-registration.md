# Permits & Registration at CERN

<div class="alert">

## Overview

As staff of an international organisation, CERN employees have a special permit status. You do not need a standard Swiss or French work permit to work at CERN.

Your legal status is managed through CERN and the host state agreements with Switzerland and France. The CERN Users Office is your main point of contact for all permit and registration matters.

## Swiss Carte de Legitimation

The **Carte de Legitimation** is an identity document issued by the DFAE (Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs) that certifies your status as a member of an international organisation. The type of card you receive depends on your nationality and contract. Common types include **B and C** (with full customs privileges), **D and E** (limited customs privileges), **P** (scientific personnel), and **S** (Swiss nationals), while types H, F, and G carry no special customs privileges.

The card is obtained through the **CERN Users Office**, which processes the application with the DFAE on your behalf. You must register within 14 days of your arrival to initiate this process. The card's validity is linked to the duration of your CERN contract and must be renewed if your contract is extended. Among its key benefits, the carte de legitimation **exempts you from standard Swiss work and residence permits** and provides certain tax and customs advantages.

## French Titre de Sejour

If you live in France -- for example, in the **Pays de Gex** -- you need a **titre de sejour** (residence permit) in addition to your CERN carte de legitimation. International organisation employees are granted a special titre de sejour category, which is different from standard work permits. You apply for it at the **prefecture of Ain** (Bourg-en-Bresse) or the sub-prefecture corresponding to your place of residence.

The application requires several documents, including your passport, proof of address, CERN contract, carte de legitimation, passport photos, and a completed application form. Keep in mind that the titre de sejour must be **renewed before its expiry date**, so it is wise to start the renewal process well in advance -- at least two months before expiry.

## The 14-Day Rule

You are required to register with the **CERN Users Office within 14 days** of your arrival. This is a strict obligation and should not be delayed. Registration triggers the carte de legitimation application process and formally establishes your legal status in Switzerland. Registering late can delay your carte de legitimation, affect your **health insurance coverage**, and lead to other administrative complications.

## Family Members

Your spouse or partner and children can receive their own **legitimation cards as dependents** of the primary holder. Your spouse or registered partner must be declared to the Users Office; common-law partners may face different requirements depending on nationality. Minor children are included in your registration automatically, though adult children may require additional paperwork.

To register family members, you will typically need to provide a marriage certificate, your children's birth certificates, **sworn translations** into English or French if the documents are in another language, and a **Hague apostille** if applicable. It is best to gather all these documents before arriving at CERN.

## Changing Residence

If you move from Switzerland to France, you must notify the CERN Users Office, apply for a French titre de sejour, and update your address. Moving in the other direction -- from France to Switzerland -- requires registering with the relevant **Swiss commune** and notifying the Users Office as well.

Any change of country of residence requires **new permits**, and the process can take several weeks, so plan ahead. You should notify the Users Office as soon as possible, ideally before the move. Deadline requirements vary by country.

## Practical Tips

Start your paperwork **immediately upon arrival** -- do not wait. Keep copies of all documents, both physical and digital, as you will need them on multiple occasions. The **CERN Users Office** is your main point of contact for any permit and registration questions.

Have **passport photos** ready in Swiss format (35x45 mm) for cards and permits. If you have family members joining you, gather all necessary documents -- certificates, translations, and apostilles -- before arriving at CERN to avoid delays.
