<h1>Childcare &amp; Schools Near CERN</h1>

      <div class="alert">
        <strong>⚠️ Important</strong><br>
        <p>Waiting lists for childcare and popular schools can be very long. Start researching and registering as early as possible, ideally before your arrival at CERN.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>CERN Childcare: Le Jardin des Particules</h2>
      <p><strong>Le Jardin des Particules</strong> is the CERN on-site creche, accepting children from 4 months to 6 years of age. It is managed by the CERN Staff Association and located on the Meyrin site, with places reserved for children of CERN employees and associated personnel.</p>
      <p>There is typically a <strong>significant waitlist</strong>, so apply as soon as you receive your CERN contract, or even earlier if possible, through CERN HR. Fees are income-dependent and generally competitive compared to local private nurseries in the Geneva area.</p>

      <h2>Local Nurseries (Creches)</h2>
      <p>On the Swiss side, creches are available in Meyrin, Vernier, and surrounding communes, managed by the commune or private operators. Registration is usually done through the commune's early childhood office (<strong>Service de la petite enfance</strong>). On the French side, creches in Saint-Genis-Pouilly, Ferney-Voltaire, and nearby towns are managed by the commune or associations -- contact the local <strong>Relais Petite Enfance</strong> for availability.</p>
      <p>Apply early, as <strong>waiting lists of 6 months or more</strong> are common on both sides of the border, and some communes require registration before the child is born. Swiss creches tend to be more expensive (CHF 100-150/day) but fees are often income-adjusted. French creches are generally cheaper (EUR 5-30/day depending on income and CAF subsidies).</p>

      <h2>Primary &amp; Secondary Schools</h2>
      <p><strong>Swiss public schools</strong> are free and French-language, with children assigned to the school in their commune of residence. The school year starts in late August, and registration is done through the commune. <strong>French public schools</strong> are also free and French-language, with registration at the local mairie. The French school year starts in September, and children are assigned based on their catchment area (carte scolaire).</p>
      <p>Note that Swiss schools in the Canton of Geneva start in late August while French schools start in September, and <strong>school holidays differ</strong> between the two countries. Both Swiss and French public schools offer <strong>integration support</strong> -- classes d'accueil in Geneva and UPE2A in France -- for children who do not yet speak French.</p>

      <h2>International Schools</h2>
      <p>The <strong>International School of Geneva (Ecolint)</strong> is the oldest international school in the world, with multiple campuses including La Grande Boissiere, Nations, and La Chataigneraie. It offers the IB curriculum in English and French, with tuition ranging from CHF 20,000 to CHF 35,000 per year. The <strong>Campus des Nations</strong>, located near the UN in Geneva, is particularly convenient for families living on the Swiss side.</p>
      <p>On the French side, the <strong>Lycee International de Ferney-Voltaire</strong> is a French public school with international sections (English, German, and others) offering free tuition with only a small fee for the international section -- it is very popular with CERN families. The <strong>Geneva English School</strong> is a private English-language primary school in Geneva following the English National Curriculum.</p>
      <p>CERN provides <strong>education grants</strong> for staff members' children attending school, which can partially offset international school tuition. Check with CERN HR for eligibility and amounts.</p>

      <h2>Higher Education &amp; After-School Activities</h2>
      <p>The <strong>University of Geneva</strong> (UniGE) and <strong>EPFL/University of Lausanne</strong> are within easy reach for older students or accompanying partners. For younger children, Swiss communes offer garderies (after-school care) and parascolaire activities, while in France centres aeres and garderies periscolaires provide similar services. Numerous <strong>sports clubs</strong> for children are also available through local communes, the CERN Staff Association, and private organisations in the area.</p>

      <h2>Tips for Families</h2>
      <p>For creches and popular international schools, apply as soon as possible -- ideally <strong>6 to 12 months in advance</strong>. If your children attend a fee-paying school, check with CERN HR about education grant eligibility, as the grant can cover a significant portion of tuition.</p>
      <p>If you plan to use public schools, verify the <strong>catchment area</strong> (secteur scolaire) before choosing your housing. The Geneva region offers a unique bilingual environment, and children attending local schools will naturally develop <strong>French skills</strong> alongside their home language -- a valuable advantage for their future.</p>
