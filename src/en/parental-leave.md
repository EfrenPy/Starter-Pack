<h1>Parental Leave at CERN</h1>
<div class="alert">
<strong>⚠️ Important</strong><br>
<p>Leave entitlements and procedures may vary depending on your contract type (staff, fellow, associate). Always confirm details with CERN HR for your specific situation.</p>
</div>
<p>Becoming a parent while working at CERN is a significant life event, and the organisation provides a framework of leave entitlements to support employees through this transition. Understanding the rules around maternity, paternity, and adoption leave — including notification deadlines and administrative steps — helps you plan effectively and ensures you receive your full entitlements without delays.</p>
<h2>Maternity Leave</h2>
<p>CERN provides <strong>16 weeks of maternity leave</strong> for staff members, which can begin up to six weeks before the expected due date and must include at least ten weeks after delivery. During maternity leave, the employee receives <strong>full salary replacement</strong>, meaning there is no reduction in income during the leave period. The leave is granted automatically once the expected due date is communicated to HR, though it is recommended to notify your supervisor and HR department as early as practical — ideally by the end of the first trimester.</p>
<p>To initiate maternity leave, submit a <strong>medical certificate</strong> confirming the expected due date through the EDH (Electronic Document Handling) system. HR will then confirm your leave dates and salary continuation. If medical complications require you to stop work earlier than planned, additional sick leave provisions may apply — contact the CERN Medical Service for guidance. After delivery, you must provide a <strong>birth certificate</strong> to HR to finalise the administrative process and activate any family allowances.</p>
<h2>Paternity Leave</h2>
<p>CERN grants <strong>10 working days of paternity leave</strong> to be taken within a reasonable period following the birth or adoption of a child. This leave is at full pay and does not reduce annual leave entitlement. It can be taken in a single block or split into separate periods, depending on your arrangement with your supervisor. To request paternity leave, submit the request through EDH and provide a birth certificate or adoption documentation once available.</p>
<p>While 10 days is the formal entitlement, some supervisors are flexible about additional arrangements such as taking annual leave or teleworking in the weeks after the birth. Discuss your plans openly with your supervisor well in advance to find an approach that works for both your family and your team.</p>
<h2>Adoption Leave</h2>
<p>CERN recognises <strong>adoption leave</strong> with entitlements that mirror maternity leave provisions. The adopting parent receives up to 16 weeks of paid leave, beginning from the date the child is placed with the family. The same notification and documentation requirements apply — submit the adoption order or placement documentation to HR through EDH, along with any required legal translations. If both parents work at CERN, the leave can be shared between them, subject to HR approval and the constraint that both cannot be on parental leave simultaneously for the full duration.</p>
<h2>Health Insurance and Pension During Leave</h2>
<p>Your <strong>CHIS health insurance</strong> coverage continues uninterrupted during maternity, paternity, and adoption leave. Since you receive full salary during these periods, your insurance contributions are deducted as normal, and there is no gap in coverage for you or your dependants. Similarly, your <strong>CERN Pension Fund</strong> contributions continue to accrue during paid leave, so the leave period counts fully towards your pension calculation and years of service.</p>
<p>If you take any period of <strong>unpaid leave</strong> (for example, an extension beyond the standard maternity leave), the situation changes — CHIS coverage may continue but with adjusted contribution arrangements, and pension accrual may be suspended. Discuss the specific implications of any unpaid leave with both HR and the Pension Fund administration before making a decision.</p>
<h2>Return to Work</h2>
<p>CERN supports flexible <strong>return-to-work arrangements</strong> for new parents. It is possible to request a temporary reduction in working hours (part-time work) for a defined period after returning from parental leave, subject to your supervisor's agreement and operational needs. Teleworking arrangements under the existing 40-percent policy can also help ease the transition back to full-time on-site work.</p>
<p>Discuss your return plans with your supervisor several weeks before the end of your leave so that any adjustments to your schedule or workload can be arranged in advance. CERN's HR department can advise on the formal process for requesting a temporary part-time arrangement and the implications for salary and pension contributions.</p>
<h2>Childcare Planning</h2>
<p>Childcare in the Geneva area is in high demand, and <strong>waiting lists for creches</strong> and nurseries can be very long — sometimes exceeding a year. If you are planning to return to work after parental leave, it is advisable to start researching childcare options as soon as you know you are expecting. The CERN Staff Association and Welcome Club maintain lists of childcare providers on both the Swiss and French sides of the border, and the CERN Market forum sometimes has recommendations from other parents.</p>
<p>Options range from <strong>public creches</strong> (often the most affordable but with the longest waiting lists) to private nurseries and childminders (assistantes maternelles in France, Tagesmutter in the Swiss-German tradition). Costs vary significantly — from around EUR 500 per month for subsidised French creches to CHF 2,000 or more for full-time private nurseries in Geneva. Factor childcare costs into your budget planning early, as they represent a significant ongoing expense for families in the region.</p>
