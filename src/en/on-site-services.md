<h1>On-Site Services at CERN</h1>

      <div class="alert">
        <strong>⚠️ Important</strong><br>
        <p>CERN on-site service hours and availability may change. Always check the CERN internal directory or ServiceNow for the latest information.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Restaurants &amp; Cafeterias</h2>
      <p>CERN's main dining option is <strong>Restaurant 1 (R1)</strong>, located on the Meyrin site. It serves a daily menu with a starter, main course, and dessert, and is open for lunch on weekdays. If you work on the French side, <strong>Restaurant 2 (R2)</strong> on the Prevessin site offers similar options. A third, smaller restaurant — <strong>R3</strong> — also sits on the Meyrin site and tends to feature lighter or alternative meals.</p>
      <p>Beyond the main restaurants, several <strong>cafeterias and coffee corners</strong> are spread across both sites, serving sandwiches, snacks, coffee, and drinks throughout the day. Meal prices typically range from about <strong>EUR 8 to EUR 15</strong> depending on what you choose, and you can pay with your CERN badge (charged to your account) or with cash.</p>

      <h2>CERN Medical Service</h2>
      <p>The CERN Medical Service is located in <strong>Building 57</strong> on the Meyrin site and provides general consultations, occupational health assessments, vaccinations, and first aid. It is open <strong>Monday to Friday, 8:00-12:00 and 13:30-17:00</strong>, and closed on weekends and CERN holidays.</p>
      <p>You can book appointments through the medical service phone line or via the <strong>CERN ServiceNow</strong> portal, and walk-ins are accepted for urgent matters. The service covers general medicine, occupational health screenings, travel vaccinations, first aid, and medical certificates. Keep in mind that it is <strong>not a substitute</strong> for a personal doctor (<em>medecin traitant</em>).</p>

      <h2>Banking on Site</h2>
      <p>A <strong>UBS bank branch</strong> operates in Building 504 on the Meyrin site, offering basic services such as account inquiries, transfers, and currency exchange. ATMs are available at the UBS branch and at several other spots across the site. The branch keeps limited hours that may differ from standard bank schedules, so check the CERN internal directory for current opening times.</p>

      <h2>Post Office</h2>
      <p>A <strong>Swiss Post counter</strong> at CERN handles sending and receiving letters and packages, including registered mail and international shipping. CERN personnel can also request a <strong>PO box</strong> at the on-site post office to receive personal mail at work. Like most on-site services, the post office has limited opening hours — check the CERN internal directory for the current schedule.</p>

      <h2>CERN Shop</h2>
      <p>The <strong>CERN Shop</strong> sits near the main reception on the Meyrin site and sells branded merchandise — T-shirts, mugs, books, and souvenirs. It is open during standard visit hours, though times may vary during holidays and CERN shutdown periods.</p>

      <h2>Library</h2>
      <p>The <strong>CERN Scientific Library</strong> on the Meyrin site provides access to scientific journals, books, conference proceedings, and CERN publications. It also offers quiet study areas, meeting rooms, and computer workstations available to all CERN personnel. If a publication is not available locally, the library can obtain it through <strong>interlibrary loan</strong> agreements with partner institutions.</p>

      <h2>Sports Facilities</h2>
      <p>CERN has a <strong>fitness centre</strong> open to all personnel, though access requires a Staff Association sports membership. A <strong>football pitch</strong> on the Meyrin site is available for organised games and casual use, and well-maintained <strong>running paths</strong> wind around both the Meyrin and Prevessin sites — popular with lunchtime joggers.</p>
      <p>The <strong>CERN Staff Association</strong> also organises numerous sports clubs covering football, tennis, badminton, yoga, climbing, sailing, and many more. Check the Staff Association website for the full list of clubs and registration details.</p>

      <h2>Emergency Numbers</h2>
      <p>For any emergency on CERN premises — fire, accidents, or medical — call the <strong>CERN Fire Brigade</strong> at <strong>74444</strong> (internal) or <strong>+41 22 767 4444</strong> from an external phone.</p>
      <p>Outside CERN, the <strong>Swiss emergency numbers</strong> are 144 (ambulance), 117 (police), and 118 (fire brigade). On the French side, dial 15 (SAMU/medical), 17 (police), or 18 (fire brigade). The European emergency number <strong>112</strong> works in both countries.</p>
