<h1>Telework Policy at CERN</h1>
      <div class="alert">
        <p>CERN's telework policy allows up to <strong>40% remote work</strong> for eligible personnel. Always check the latest version of Operational Circular No. 7 (OC7) for the most current rules.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>CERN's telework policy is governed by <strong>Operational Circular No. 7 (OC7)</strong>. It establishes a hybrid working model that aims to balance on-site presence with flexibility for remote work.</p>
      <p>The policy recognizes that many tasks can be performed remotely while maintaining the collaborative environment that is essential for CERN's research mission. However, on-site presence remains important for teamwork, hands-on activities, and building professional relationships.</p>

      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>Telework is available to <strong>staff members</strong> and <strong>fellows</strong> with an active CERN contract. Doctoral students should check with their supervisor regarding eligibility, as it may depend on the experiment or group they belong to.</p>
      <p>Not all roles are eligible for telework. Positions requiring hands-on technical work, laboratory presence, or shift duties may not qualify. New employees are generally recommended to work on-site initially to build relationships and learn procedures before starting to telework.</p>

      <h2>The 40% Limit</h2>
      <p>The maximum proportion of working time that can be spent teleworking is <strong>40%</strong>, which typically translates to about 2 days per week for a full-time schedule. This percentage is calculated over a reference period, not on a strict weekly basis, so some weeks you may telework more and others less as long as the average stays within the limit.</p>
      <p>Your supervisor has discretion in how the schedule is organized. Part-time employees have the same 40% ratio applied to their contracted hours.</p>

      <h2>Approval Process</h2>
      <p>To begin teleworking, you must submit a formal request through <strong>EDH</strong> (Electronic Document Handling). Your direct supervisor must approve the request, and your section leader or group leader provides the final endorsement. Telework agreements are typically reviewed on an annual basis.</p>

      <h2>Location Requirements</h2>
      <p>Where you telework from matters, as there are important legal and administrative considerations. You must telework from your <strong>country of residence</strong> (typically Switzerland or France). Working from a third country outside CH/FR requires special approval and is generally limited.</p>
      <p>Extended work from another country may have <strong>tax implications</strong>, so consult HR if you are in doubt. Your insurance coverage may also be affected if you telework from an unapproved location.</p>

      <h2>Equipment &amp; Connectivity</h2>
      <p>CERN provides the essential tools for remote work, including a <strong>laptop</strong> and VPN access through the <strong>CERN VPN client</strong> for a secure connection to internal resources. Zoom and Microsoft Teams are available for video meetings and collaboration.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for your home internet connection and for ensuring a suitable working environment. If you need additional equipment such as a monitor or keyboard, discuss it with your supervisor.</p>

      <h2>Schedule &amp; Availability</h2>
      <p>When teleworking, you are expected to maintain your regular availability and be reachable by your team. You must be reachable during <strong>core hours</strong> (09:30–11:30 and 14:00–16:00), and you should keep your calendar visible and up to date so colleagues know your availability.</p>
      <p>Flexible scheduling is possible within the agreed limits, but coordinate with your team to avoid conflicts. Stay responsive on Mattermost, email, and other communication channels during working hours.</p>

      <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
      <p>It is a good idea to discuss expectations and preferred telework days with your supervisor early in your contract. Establishing a <strong>consistent routine</strong> helps maintain productivity and a healthy work-life balance, and staying visible to your team through active participation in meetings and team channels makes remote collaboration smoother.</p>
      <p>Prioritize on-site attendance for important events, workshops, and team meetings. Finally, keep your telework agreement up to date and remember to renew it before it expires.</p>
