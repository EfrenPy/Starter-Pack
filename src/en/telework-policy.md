# Telework Policy at CERN

<div class="alert">
<p>CERN's telework policy allows up to <strong>40% remote work</strong> for eligible personnel. Always check the latest version of Operational Circular No. 7 (OC7) for the most current rules.</p>
</div>

## Overview

CERN's telework policy is governed by **Operational Circular No. 7 (OC7)**. It establishes a hybrid working model that aims to balance on-site presence with flexibility for remote work.

The policy recognizes that many tasks can be performed remotely while maintaining the collaborative environment that is essential for CERN's research mission. However, on-site presence remains important for teamwork, hands-on activities, and building professional relationships.

## Eligibility

Telework is available to **staff members** and **fellows** with an active CERN contract. Doctoral students should check with their supervisor regarding eligibility, as it may depend on the experiment or group they belong to.

Not all roles are eligible for telework. Positions requiring hands-on technical work, laboratory presence, or shift duties may not qualify. New employees are generally recommended to work on-site initially to build relationships and learn procedures before starting to telework.

## The 40% Limit

The maximum proportion of working time that can be spent teleworking is **40%**, which typically translates to about 2 days per week for a full-time schedule. This percentage is calculated over a reference period, not on a strict weekly basis, so some weeks you may telework more and others less as long as the average stays within the limit.

Your supervisor has discretion in how the schedule is organized. Part-time employees have the same 40% ratio applied to their contracted hours.

## Approval Process

To begin teleworking, you must submit a formal request through **EDH** (Electronic Document Handling). Your direct supervisor must approve the request, and your section leader or group leader provides the final endorsement. Telework agreements are typically reviewed on an annual basis.

## Location Requirements

Where you telework from matters, as there are important legal and administrative considerations. You must telework from your **country of residence** (typically Switzerland or France). Working from a third country outside CH/FR requires special approval and is generally limited.

Extended work from another country may have **tax implications**, so consult HR if you are in doubt. Your insurance coverage may also be affected if you telework from an unapproved location.

## Equipment & Connectivity

CERN provides the essential tools for remote work, including a **laptop** and VPN access through the **CERN VPN client** for a secure connection to internal resources. Zoom and Microsoft Teams are available for video meetings and collaboration.

You are responsible for your home internet connection and for ensuring a suitable working environment. If you need additional equipment such as a monitor or keyboard, discuss it with your supervisor.

## Schedule & Availability

When teleworking, you are expected to maintain your regular availability and be reachable by your team. You must be reachable during **core hours** (09:30–11:30 and 14:00–16:00), and you should keep your calendar visible and up to date so colleagues know your availability.

Flexible scheduling is possible within the agreed limits, but coordinate with your team to avoid conflicts. Stay responsive on Mattermost, email, and other communication channels during working hours.

## Practical Tips

It is a good idea to discuss expectations and preferred telework days with your supervisor early in your contract. Establishing a **consistent routine** helps maintain productivity and a healthy work-life balance, and staying visible to your team through active participation in meetings and team channels makes remote collaboration smoother.

Prioritize on-site attendance for important events, workshops, and team meetings. Finally, keep your telework agreement up to date and remember to renew it before it expires.
