<h1>Departure Guide</h1>

      <div class="alert">
        <strong>⚠️ Important</strong><br>
        <p>Start your departure preparations at least 2-3 months before your last day. The clearance process has many steps and some have strict deadlines.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Notice Periods</h2>
      <p>The notice period you must give before leaving CERN varies depending on your contract type. <strong>Staff members</strong> are typically required to give <strong>3 months' notice</strong> before their departure date. <strong>Fellows</strong> usually work until the end of their fixed-term contract, though early termination is possible with appropriate notice. <strong>Students</strong> similarly end their association at contract expiry.</p>
      <p>Always check your individual contract and the <strong>CERN Staff Rules and Regulations</strong> for the exact notice requirements that apply to your situation. It is strongly recommended to inform your <strong>supervisor and HR department</strong> well in advance so they can plan for your transition and help you navigate the departure process smoothly.</p>

      <h2>CERN Clearance Procedure</h2>
      <p>Before leaving CERN, you must complete the official <strong>clearance procedure</strong>, which typically begins approximately <strong>1 month before your departure date</strong>. This involves several steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Return all CERN equipment</strong>: laptop, mobile phone, keys, and any other items provided by your group or department.</li>
        <li><strong>Return your access badge</strong> at Building 55 (Registration Service).</li>
        <li><strong>Close your IT accounts</strong> or request a grace period for email access if needed for ongoing collaborations.</li>
        <li><strong>Settle any outstanding financial obligations</strong>, including library fines, restaurant debts, and any other balances owed to CERN.</li>
        <li><strong>Complete the official clearance form</strong> via EDH (Electronic Document Handling). This form is routed to all relevant services for sign-off.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Make sure to start this process early, as delays in any single step can hold up your final settlement and departure certificate.</p>

      <h2>Pension Options</h2>
      <p>Your pension options upon leaving CERN depend on your <strong>years of service</strong>. If you have worked at CERN for <strong>fewer than 5 years</strong>, you will receive a lump-sum transfer value. With <strong>5 to 10 years</strong> of service, you can choose between a deferred pension or transferring the value to a new employer's pension scheme.</p>
      <p>If you have <strong>10 or more years</strong> of service, you have the option to leave your pension in the CERN Pension Fund until you reach retirement age. Contact the <strong>Pension Fund office</strong> as early as possible to discuss your options. Decisions regarding your pension must be made <strong>within a set period after departure</strong>, so do not delay.</p>

      <h2>Health Insurance Continuity</h2>
      <p>Your CERN Health Insurance Scheme (CHIS) coverage <strong>ends on your last day of contract</strong>. It is essential to arrange alternative health coverage before you leave:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Moving to France</strong>: register with CPAM (Caisse Primaire d'Assurance Maladie) / Assurance Maladie.</li>
        <li><strong>Moving to Switzerland</strong>: enrol in mandatory LAMal (basic health insurance) within 3 months of leaving CERN.</li>
        <li><strong>Moving to another country</strong>: arrange local health coverage in your destination country before your departure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>CERN can provide a <strong>certificate of prior coverage</strong>, which may be required by your new insurer to waive waiting periods or pre-existing condition exclusions.</p>

      <h2>Deregistration</h2>
      <p>If you have been <strong>living in Switzerland</strong>, you must deregister from your commune (<em>signaler un d&eacute;part</em>) before leaving. Visit your local commune office with your departure date and forwarding address. If you have been <strong>living in France</strong>, notify the mairie (town hall) if you registered there.</p>
      <p>Additionally, remember to <strong>update your address</strong> with banks, insurance providers, utilities, and any subscription services. Close or redirect your <strong>bank accounts</strong> as needed, and ensure any standing orders or direct debits are cancelled or transferred.</p>

      <h2>Moving Logistics</h2>
      <p>CERN provides a <strong>relocation allowance</strong> for some contract types, so check with HR whether you are eligible. Start getting <strong>quotes from international moving companies</strong> well in advance, as availability can be limited during peak periods (summer months).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check <strong>customs requirements</strong> for your destination country, especially if you are shipping personal belongings or a vehicle.</li>
        <li>Consider selling furniture and household items locally through the <strong>CERN March&eacute;</strong> or Facebook groups for CERN departures.</li>
        <li>Set up <strong>mail forwarding</strong> through La Poste (France) or Swiss Post (Switzerland) to ensure you receive any correspondence after leaving.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Plan your move carefully and give yourself enough time to handle unexpected complications. Leaving CERN is a significant transition, but with proper preparation it can be a smooth process.</p>
