# Departure Guide

<div class="alert">
<strong>⚠️ Important</strong><br>
<p>Start your departure preparations at least 2-3 months before your last day. The clearance process has many steps and some have strict deadlines.</p>
</div>

## Notice Periods

The notice period you must give before leaving CERN varies depending on your contract type. **Staff members** are typically required to give **3 months' notice** before their departure date. **Fellows** usually work until the end of their fixed-term contract, though early termination is possible with appropriate notice. **Students** similarly end their association at contract expiry.

Always check your individual contract and the **CERN Staff Rules and Regulations** for the exact notice requirements that apply to your situation. It is strongly recommended to inform your **supervisor and HR department** well in advance so they can plan for your transition and help you navigate the departure process smoothly.

## CERN Clearance Procedure

Before leaving CERN, you must complete the official **clearance procedure**, which typically begins approximately **1 month before your departure date**. The first step is to **return all CERN equipment** — your laptop, mobile phone, keys, and any other items provided by your group or department. You must also **return your access badge** at Building 55 (Registration Service) and either **close your IT accounts** or request a grace period for email access if you need it for ongoing collaborations.

On the financial side, you are expected to **settle any outstanding obligations** such as library fines, restaurant debts, and any other balances owed to CERN. Once everything is in order, you complete the **official clearance form via EDH** (Electronic Document Handling), which is then routed to all relevant services for sign-off. Make sure to start this process early, as delays in any single step can hold up your final settlement and departure certificate.

## Pension Options

Your pension options upon leaving CERN depend on your **years of service**. If you have worked at CERN for **fewer than 5 years**, you will receive a lump-sum transfer value. With **5 to 10 years** of service, you can choose between a deferred pension or transferring the value to a new employer's pension scheme.

If you have **10 or more years** of service, you have the option to leave your pension in the CERN Pension Fund until you reach retirement age. Contact the **Pension Fund office** as early as possible to discuss your options. Decisions regarding your pension must be made **within a set period after departure**, so do not delay.

## Health Insurance Continuity

Your CERN Health Insurance Scheme (CHIS) coverage **ends on your last day of contract**, so it is essential to arrange alternative health coverage before you leave. If you are **moving to France**, you should register with the CPAM (Caisse Primaire d'Assurance Maladie) / Assurance Maladie. Those **moving to Switzerland** must enrol in the mandatory LAMal basic health insurance within 3 months of leaving CERN, while anyone **relocating to another country** should arrange local health coverage in their destination before departure.

CERN can provide a **certificate of prior coverage**, which may be required by your new insurer to waive waiting periods or pre-existing condition exclusions.

## Deregistration

If you have been **living in Switzerland**, you must deregister from your commune (*signaler un d&eacute;part*) before leaving. Visit your local commune office with your departure date and forwarding address. If you have been **living in France**, notify the mairie (town hall) if you registered there.

Additionally, remember to **update your address** with banks, insurance providers, utilities, and any subscription services. Close or redirect your **bank accounts** as needed, and ensure any standing orders or direct debits are cancelled or transferred.

## Moving Logistics

CERN provides a **relocation allowance** for some contract types, so check with HR whether you are eligible. Start getting **quotes from international moving companies** well in advance, as availability can be limited during peak periods (summer months). Be sure to check the **customs requirements** for your destination country, especially if you are shipping personal belongings or a vehicle. You may also want to consider selling furniture and household items locally through the **CERN March&eacute;** or Facebook groups dedicated to CERN departures, which can simplify your move considerably.

Before you leave, set up **mail forwarding** through La Poste (France) or Swiss Post (Switzerland) to ensure you continue receiving correspondence after your departure. Plan your move carefully and give yourself enough time to handle unexpected complications. Leaving CERN is a significant transition, but with proper preparation it can be a smooth process.
