<h1>Banking Setup Near CERN</h1>

      <div class="alert">
        <strong>⚠️ Note</strong><br>
        <p>Banking products, fees, and requirements may change. Always verify with the bank directly before opening an account.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Why You Need Bank Accounts</h2>
      <p>CERN pays all salaries in <strong>Swiss francs (CHF)</strong>, so a Swiss bank account is essential for receiving your pay. If you live in France, you will also need a <strong>French bank account</strong> for rent payments, utilities, and direct debits in euros (EUR). Living near the Swiss-French border means dealing with two currencies on a daily basis, and having accounts in both simplifies payments while avoiding costly exchange fees.</p>

      <h2>Swiss Bank Accounts</h2>
      <p>The most commonly used Swiss banks among CERN employees are <strong>UBS</strong> and <strong>BCGE</strong> (Banque Cantonale de Geneve). Credit Suisse has been fully integrated into UBS. To open an account you will need your <strong>carte de legitimation</strong> (issued by CERN/DFAE), a valid passport or ID, your employment contract or a CERN attestation, and proof of address if available.</p>
      <p>Monthly maintenance fees typically range from <strong>CHF 5 to 15</strong>, depending on the bank and account type, though some banks offer reduced fees for CERN staff. Opening a Swiss account requires an <strong>in-person appointment</strong> at the branch. Bring all your documents, and the account is usually active within a few business days. A debit card (Maestro or Visa Debit) will be sent to you by post.</p>

      <h2>French Bank Accounts</h2>
      <p>Several traditional banks have branches near CERN, including <strong>BNP Paribas</strong>, <strong>Societe Generale</strong>, and <strong>Credit Agricole</strong> in Saint-Genis-Pouilly and Ferney-Voltaire. If you prefer a fully digital process, online banks like <strong>Boursorama</strong> and <strong>Fortuneo</strong> offer fee-free current accounts and are popular with CERN employees living in France.</p>
      <p>To open a French account you will need a <strong>titre de sejour</strong> or attestation from the prefecture, a valid passport or ID, proof of address in France (such as a utility bill or rental contract), and your employment contract. Traditional banks require an in-person appointment, while online banks can be set up remotely in a few days. You will need a French <strong>RIB</strong> (Releve d'Identite Bancaire) for rent and utility payments.</p>

      <h2>On-Site Banking at CERN</h2>
      <p>There is a <strong>UBS branch located at CERN</strong> in Building 504, specifically serving CERN personnel. The staff there are experienced with the carte de legitimation and CERN employment contracts, which makes the process straightforward. UBS and BCGE <strong>ATMs</strong> are also available on the Meyrin site for cash withdrawals in CHF.</p>
      <p>The on-site UBS branch typically operates on <strong>limited hours</strong> (mornings only on certain weekdays), so check the CERN website or internal directory for the current schedule. It is strongly recommended to <strong>book an appointment in advance</strong>, especially during arrival periods in September and October when many newcomers open accounts at the same time.</p>

      <h2>Multi-Currency &amp; Digital Banks</h2>
      <p><strong>Wise</strong> (formerly TransferWise) is very popular among CERN employees, offering multi-currency accounts with real exchange rates and low fees -- ideal for CHF/EUR conversions and international transfers. <strong>Revolut</strong> provides similar multi-currency features along with free card payments abroad and competitive exchange rates, making it useful for daily cross-border spending. <strong>N26</strong>, a German digital bank, offers free euro accounts available to French residents and works well as a secondary EUR account.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that digital banks may <strong>not always be accepted</strong> for salary deposits by CERN, and they may lack the French RIB functionality needed for some direct debits. They are best used as <strong>complementary accounts</strong> alongside a traditional Swiss or French bank rather than as your primary banking solution.</p>

      <h2>Salary Payment</h2>
      <p>CERN pays all salaries in <strong>Swiss francs (CHF)</strong>, so you will need to provide a CHF-denominated IBAN to the HR department. If you prefer, CERN allows you to <strong>split your salary</strong> between multiple bank accounts -- for example, part in CHF to a Swiss account and part converted to EUR to a French account. Contact HR or the payroll department to set this up.</p>
      <p>Be aware that your <strong>first salary payment</strong> may take 4 to 6 weeks after your start date. Plan to have enough savings to cover your initial expenses -- deposit, first month's rent, and living costs -- during this waiting period.</p>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <p>Prioritise opening a <strong>Swiss bank account</strong> as soon as possible after arrival so you can receive your salary without delay. If you live in France, open a French account for rent, utilities, and local payments, since many landlords require a French RIB for direct debit.</p>
      <p>For everyday cross-border spending -- groceries in France, coffee in Switzerland -- digital banks like <strong>Wise</strong> or <strong>Revolut</strong> offer the best exchange rates and lowest fees. Avoid currency exchange offices at Geneva airport and in tourist areas, as they charge high commissions. Use your bank card or digital bank instead.</p>
