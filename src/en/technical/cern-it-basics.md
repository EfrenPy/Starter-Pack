<h1>CERN IT Basics for Newcomers</h1>

      <h2>Your CERN Computing Account</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Activation:</strong> Visit <a href="https://account.cern.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">account.cern.ch</a> to activate your CERN computing account. You will need your CERN ID number and the initial password provided during registration.</li>
        <li><strong>Username and email:</strong> Your CERN username is typically your first initial + surname (e.g., jsmith). Your CERN email will be username@cern.ch.</li>
        <li><strong>Password policy:</strong> CERN requires strong passwords with minimum length and complexity. Change your password regularly through the account management portal.</li>
        <li><strong>Two-factor authentication (2FA):</strong> Enable 2FA for enhanced security. CERN supports TOTP apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator) for second-factor verification.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Wi-Fi: eduroam</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>eduroam:</strong> The primary Wi-Fi network at CERN. Connect using your CERN credentials: username@cern.ch as the identity and your CERN password.</li>
        <li><strong>eduroam CAT:</strong> For the best and most secure setup, download the configuration profile from <a href="https://cat.eduroam.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cat.eduroam.org</a>. This ensures correct certificate validation.</li>
        <li><strong>CERN-GUEST:</strong> A fallback network available without CERN credentials. Limited bandwidth and requires accepting terms of use. Useful for visitors or if eduroam is not working.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key CERN Systems</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>EDH (Electronic Document Handling):</strong> CERN's workflow system for travel requests, leave applications, expense claims, contract extensions, and other administrative processes. Access via the CERN intranet.</li>
        <li><strong>ServiceNow:</strong> The central platform for IT support tickets, HR requests, facility issues, and general service requests. Access at cern.service-now.com.</li>
        <li><strong>Indico:</strong> CERN's meeting and event management system. Used for scheduling meetings, conferences, and lectures. Access at indico.cern.ch.</li>
        <li><strong>CERN Phonebook:</strong> Find people, their contact details, office locations, and organisational structure. Access at phonebook.cern.ch.</li>
        <li><strong>CDS (CERN Document Server):</strong> Repository for CERN publications, technical notes, and reports. Access at cds.cern.ch.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Service Desk</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ServiceNow portal:</strong> The preferred way to request IT support. Create a ticket at cern.service-now.com describing your issue. You can track the status of your requests there.</li>
        <li><strong>Phone:</strong> Call the CERN Service Desk at extension 77777 (or +41 22 767 7777 from outside CERN) for urgent issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Common self-service:</strong> Password resets, mailing list management, and software licence requests can often be handled through the self-service portal without opening a ticket.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Printing, VPN, Software</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Printing:</strong> CERN uses a centralised printing service. Install the CERN print drivers and send jobs to the nearest printer using your CERN credentials for authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>VPN:</strong> Use the CERN VPN to access internal resources from outside CERN. Download the VPN client from the CERN software portal and connect using your CERN credentials.</li>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> CERN provides licensed software through the Software Portal (cern.ch/software). Available titles include Microsoft Office, MATLAB, and various development tools.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What to Do When Something Doesn't Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check known issues:</strong> Before reporting, check the ServiceNow known issues page and the CERN IT status page for any ongoing outages or maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic troubleshooting:</strong> Clear your browser cache, try incognito/private mode, or try a different browser. Many CERN web services work best with Chrome or Firefox.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Service Desk:</strong> If the issue persists, open a ServiceNow ticket with a clear description of the problem, any error messages, and steps you have already tried. Include your ticket number when following up.</li>
      </ul>
