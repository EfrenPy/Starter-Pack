# CERN IT Basics for Newcomers

## Your CERN Computing Account

- **Activation:** Visit <a href="https://account.cern.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">account.cern.ch</a> to activate your CERN computing account. You will need your CERN ID number and the initial password provided during registration.
- **Username and email:** Your CERN username is typically your first initial + surname (e.g., jsmith). Your CERN email will be username@cern.ch.
- **Password policy:** CERN requires strong passwords with minimum length and complexity. Change your password regularly through the account management portal.
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA):** Enable 2FA for enhanced security. CERN supports TOTP apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator) for second-factor verification.

## Wi-Fi: eduroam

- **eduroam:** The primary Wi-Fi network at CERN. Connect using your CERN credentials: username@cern.ch as the identity and your CERN password.
- **eduroam CAT:** For the best and most secure setup, download the configuration profile from <a href="https://cat.eduroam.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cat.eduroam.org</a>. This ensures correct certificate validation.
- **CERN-GUEST:** A fallback network available without CERN credentials. Limited bandwidth and requires accepting terms of use. Useful for visitors or if eduroam is not working.

## Key CERN Systems

- **EDH (Electronic Document Handling):** CERN's workflow system for travel requests, leave applications, expense claims, contract extensions, and other administrative processes. Access via the CERN intranet.
- **ServiceNow:** The central platform for IT support tickets, HR requests, facility issues, and general service requests. Access at cern.service-now.com.
- **Indico:** CERN's meeting and event management system. Used for scheduling meetings, conferences, and lectures. Access at indico.cern.ch.
- **CERN Phonebook:** Find people, their contact details, office locations, and organisational structure. Access at phonebook.cern.ch.
- **CDS (CERN Document Server):** Repository for CERN publications, technical notes, and reports. Access at cds.cern.ch.

## Service Desk

- **ServiceNow portal:** The preferred way to request IT support. Create a ticket at cern.service-now.com describing your issue. You can track the status of your requests there.
- **Phone:** Call the CERN Service Desk at extension 77777 (or +41 22 767 7777 from outside CERN) for urgent issues.
- **Common self-service:** Password resets, mailing list management, and software licence requests can often be handled through the self-service portal without opening a ticket.

## Printing, VPN, Software

- **Printing:** CERN uses a centralised printing service. Install the CERN print drivers and send jobs to the nearest printer using your CERN credentials for authentication.
- **VPN:** Use the CERN VPN to access internal resources from outside CERN. Download the VPN client from the CERN software portal and connect using your CERN credentials.
- **Software:** CERN provides licensed software through the Software Portal (cern.ch/software). Available titles include Microsoft Office, MATLAB, and various development tools.

## What to Do When Something Doesn't Work

- **Check known issues:** Before reporting, check the ServiceNow known issues page and the CERN IT status page for any ongoing outages or maintenance.
- **Basic troubleshooting:** Clear your browser cache, try incognito/private mode, or try a different browser. Many CERN web services work best with Chrome or Firefox.
- **Contact Service Desk:** If the issue persists, open a ServiceNow ticket with a clear description of the problem, any error messages, and steps you have already tried. Include your ticket number when following up.
