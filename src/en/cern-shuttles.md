# CERN Shuttle Service

<div class="alert">
<strong>ℹ️ Important</strong><br>
<p>You must have a valid CERN access card to board shuttles. Drivers will check your badge at boarding. If you forget your card, ask to be dropped at Building 55 for registration procedures.</p>
</div>

## Overview

CERN operates a **free shuttle service** for all personnel and visitors with valid access cards. The shuttles connect the two main CERN sites (Meyrin in Switzerland and Prévessin in France) as well as key locations within each site. The service runs approximately from **07:00 to 19:00** on weekdays, with shuttles every 10-20 minutes depending on the circuit.

## Shuttle Circuits

### Circuit 1 - Meyrin (Internal)

This circuit operates entirely within the **Meyrin site** and connects the main buildings, restaurants, and parking areas. It's particularly useful for moving between different parts of the Swiss campus during the workday. The frequency is approximately every 15 minutes during working hours.

### Circuit 2 - Prévessin via FH Schumann

Circuit 2 connects the **Meyrin site to Prévessin**, passing through the FH Schumann area. This is one of the most-used circuits for employees working across both sites or living in the French side. It runs approximately every 15-20 minutes during peak hours.

### Circuit 3 - LHC Shifts

This circuit is specifically designed for **LHC (Large Hadron Collider) shift workers** and operates during shift periods. It provides transportation to and from the LHC experimental areas and control rooms, often running outside standard working hours to accommodate shift schedules.

### Circuit 5 - Prévessin

Circuit 5 provides a direct connection to the **Prévessin site**, serving the French side of CERN. It's essential for employees whose work is primarily based in Prévessin, including many experimental areas and offices. Frequency is similar to Circuit 2.

| **Restaurant R3**      | Near Theory area                       |
| **Baird Auditorium**   | Main auditorium area                   |
| **Prévessin Entrance** | French site entrance                   |

## How to Use

1. **Check your access card** is valid before boarding
2. **Check the timetable** on the CERN mobility website or at major stops
3. **Wave to signal** the driver to stop (shuttles don't always stop at every stop if no one is waiting)
4. **Badge check** - Have your access card ready for inspection

## Real-Time Information

- Check the **CERN mobility map** at [gis-static.web.cern.ch/mapcern](https://gis-static.web.cern.ch/mapcern/mapcern-integrated.html) for real-time shuttle positions
- The **CERN Service Portal** has live departure times at major stops
- Download the **Adams-mobile** app to generate 24-hour temporary access passes if needed

## Tips

- During **LHC shutdown periods**, some circuits may have reduced schedules
- **Arrive early** at stops during peak hours (08:00-09:00 and 17:00-18:00)
- If you **forget your access card**, the driver will drop you at Building 55 where you can obtain a temporary pass
- During **bad weather** or road works, expect possible delays
- The shuttles are **free** and funded by CERN - no ticket needed
