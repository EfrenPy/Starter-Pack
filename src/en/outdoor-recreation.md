# Outdoor Recreation

<div class="alert">
<strong>💡 Tip</strong><br>
<p>The Geneva region offers outdoor activities year-round. Many CERN clubs organise group outings that are perfect for newcomers.</p>
</div>

## Hiking

You will not be short of trails here. **Mont Salève**, the mountain Genevois treat as their own backyard, is a quick cable-car ride from Veyrier and rewards you with sweeping views over the city, the lake, and Mont Blanc. Once you are ready for something longer, the **Jura mountains** have well-marked routes around the Col de la Faucille and up to the Crêt de la Neige, the highest point of the range.

For something more low-key, the paths along the **Rhône and Arve rivers** run right through the city and are perfect for an after-work walk. If you prefer a wilder setting, the **Gorges de l'Orbe** offer a dramatic canyon trail that feels surprisingly remote. Most of these hikes are reachable by public transport, so you do not need a car to get started.

## Skiing and Winter Sports

Some of the best skiing in Europe is right on your doorstep. The **Grand Massif** (Flaine, Samoëns) and **Portes du Soleil** (Avoriaz, Châtel) both have huge piste networks suited to every level, while **Chamonix-Mont Blanc** delivers the kind of high-altitude terrain that draws skiers from around the world. All three areas are one to two hours away by car.

The **CERN Ski Club** runs group trips throughout the season and can help you get discounted lift passes, which is worth knowing given Swiss and French pass prices. If downhill is not your thing, **cross-country skiing** trails wind through the quiet Jura forests. And back in town, the **Vernets ice rink** in Geneva is open for public skating sessions all winter.

## Lake Geneva and Water Sports

Lake Geneva shapes daily life in the region, and in summer it becomes the main gathering spot. Public beaches like **Genève-Plage**, **Baby Plage**, and **Plage des Eaux-Vives** fill up quickly on warm days. You can rent **sailing** boats and **stand-up paddleboards** from several points along the shore, and the water is clean enough to swim in comfortably.

The **CGN boat service** runs scenic crossings to Lausanne, Montreux, and Evian that make for a great half-day outing. And you will quickly get used to spotting the **Jet d'Eau**, Geneva's 140-metre water fountain, from just about everywhere along the lakeshore.

## Day Trips

CERN sits in one of Europe's best-connected corners, so weekend day trips are easy. Within about 45 minutes you can reach **Annecy**, whose turquoise alpine lake and beautifully preserved old town make it one of the most popular outings from Geneva. **Chamonix** is roughly an hour away and offers dramatic mountain scenery plus the famous Aiguille du Midi cable car, which takes you to over 3,800 metres. In the other direction, **Lausanne** is also 45 minutes out and is home to the Olympic Museum and a lively lakeside centre.

If you have a full day, **Lyon** is about two hours south and well worth the trip for its UNESCO-listed old quarter and its reputation as the gastronomy capital of France. For something shorter and more relaxed, **Yvoire** is a tiny medieval village right on the shores of Lake Geneva that you can easily visit in an afternoon.

## CERN Outdoor Clubs

One of the easiest ways to explore the region and meet people outside your own team is through the CERN clubs. The **CERN Ski Club**, the **CERN Mountaineering Club**, the **CERN Running Club**, and the **CERN Cycling Club** all welcome newcomers regardless of fitness level, and they tend to attract a good mix of people from across departments and experiments.

What they offer ranges from casual weekend hikes and weekly training runs to fully organised alpine expeditions and multi-day cycling tours. The **CERN clubs directory** on the Staff Association website has up-to-date schedules, activity descriptions, and instructions on how to join.
