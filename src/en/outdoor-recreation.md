<h1>Outdoor Recreation</h1>

      <div class="alert">
        <strong>💡 Tip</strong><br>
        <p>The Geneva region offers outdoor activities year-round. Many CERN clubs organise group outings that are perfect for newcomers.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Hiking</h2>
      <p>The area surrounding CERN is a paradise for hikers of all levels. <strong>Mont Salève</strong>, often called Geneva's home mountain, is accessible by cable car from Veyrier and rewards you with panoramic views of the city, the lake, and Mont Blanc. For longer excursions, the <strong>Jura mountains</strong> offer routes around the Col de la Faucille and Crêt de la Neige, the highest point of the range.</p>
      <p>Closer to home, pleasant walks follow the banks of the <strong>Rhône and Arve rivers</strong> right through Geneva. For a more dramatic landscape, the <strong>Gorges de l'Orbe</strong> offer a striking canyon trail. Many of these hikes are accessible by public transport, making it easy to explore without a car.</p>

      <h2>Skiing &amp; Winter Sports</h2>
      <p>Several world-class ski resorts lie within one to two hours of CERN. The <strong>Grand Massif</strong> (Flaine, Samoëns) and <strong>Portes du Soleil</strong> (Avoriaz, Châtel) offer extensive piste networks for all abilities, while <strong>Chamonix-Mont Blanc</strong> provides some of the most spectacular high-altitude skiing in the Alps.</p>
      <p>The <strong>CERN Ski Club</strong> organises group trips throughout the season and can help you access discounted lift passes. For a quieter experience, <strong>cross-country skiing</strong> trails wind through the Jura forests. Back in town, the <strong>Vernets ice rink</strong> in Geneva is open for public skating sessions.</p>

      <h2>Lake Geneva &amp; Water Sports</h2>
      <p>Lake Geneva is the centrepiece of the region's outdoor life. Public beaches such as <strong>Genève-Plage</strong>, <strong>Baby Plage</strong>, and <strong>Plage des Eaux-Vives</strong> are popular spots for swimming during the warmer months. You can also try <strong>sailing</strong> and <strong>stand-up paddleboarding</strong> from various rental points along the shore.</p>
      <p>The <strong>CGN boat service</strong> runs scenic crossings to Lausanne, Montreux, and Evian, making for wonderful half-day outings. Do not miss the <strong>Jet d'Eau</strong>, Geneva's iconic 140-metre water fountain visible from all around the lake.</p>

      <h2>Day Trips</h2>
      <p>The location of CERN puts many remarkable destinations within easy reach:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annecy</strong> (45 min) — a stunning alpine lake and a beautifully preserved old town</li>
        <li><strong>Chamonix</strong> (1 h) — dramatic mountain scenery and the famous Aiguille du Midi cable car</li>
        <li><strong>Lausanne</strong> (45 min) — home of the Olympic Museum and a vibrant lakeside city</li>
        <li><strong>Lyon</strong> (2 h) — the gastronomy capital of France with a UNESCO-listed old quarter</li>
        <li><strong>Yvoire</strong> — a medieval village perched on the shores of Lake Geneva</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>CERN Outdoor Clubs</h2>
      <p>CERN hosts several clubs dedicated to outdoor pursuits, including the <strong>CERN Ski Club</strong>, the <strong>CERN Mountaineering Club</strong>, the <strong>CERN Running Club</strong>, and the <strong>CERN Cycling Club</strong>. These clubs welcome participants of all levels, from complete beginners to seasoned athletes, and are an excellent way to meet colleagues from different departments and experiments.</p>
      <p>Activities range from casual weekend hikes and weekly training runs to organised alpine expeditions and cycling tours. Check the <strong>CERN clubs directory</strong> on the Staff Association website for current offerings, schedules, and how to join.</p>
