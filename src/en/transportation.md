# Transportation Near CERN

<div class="alert">
<strong>⚠️ Note</strong><br>
<p>Schedules, fares, and routes may change. Always check official transport websites for the latest information.</p>
</div>

## Getting to CERN

The main CERN campus is located in **Meyrin, Switzerland**, accessible via Entrance B on Route de Meyrin. This is where most offices, restaurants, and the main reception are found. The second campus is in **Prevessin-Moens, France**, hosting several experimental areas and offices, with a free CERN shuttle connecting the two sites.

You can reach CERN by public bus, CERN shuttle, bicycle, car, or regional train to nearby stations. The best option depends on where you live, though most employees rely on a combination of public transport and cycling.

## Public Transport (TPG)

The most important bus line for CERN employees is **bus 68**, which runs from Geneva city centre (Rive) through Meyrin to the CERN stop every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours. Even faster is **tram 18**, which runs from Plan-les-Ouates through Geneva to CERN as its terminus, making it the quickest public transport link between Geneva centre and CERN at about 25 minutes from Cornavin station.

The Geneva area uses the **Unireso fare system**, and a monthly pass costs approximately CHF 70, covering all TPG buses, trams, and local trains within your selected zones. Tickets can be purchased via the **TPG app** (recommended), at ticket machines at major stops, or on board with a surcharge. Contactless payment is accepted on some machines.

## CERN Shuttle

CERN operates a **free internal shuttle bus** between the Meyrin and Prevessin sites, available to all CERN personnel and visitors with a valid access card. The shuttle runs every 15 to 20 minutes during standard working hours (approximately 08:00 to 18:00, Monday to Friday) and connects key buildings on both sites, with stops at the main entrances and major building clusters. Check the CERN transport page for the current timetable.

## Cycling

The area around CERN is generally **flat terrain**, making cycling a practical and popular commuting option, especially from Meyrin and Saint-Genis-Pouilly. CERN provides bike racks at most buildings across both sites, with covered racks available near main entrances. **Dedicated bike paths** connect Meyrin and Saint-Genis-Pouilly to CERN, and the route from Geneva centre follows well-marked paths along Route de Meyrin.

Geneva offers **bike-sharing services** such as Donkey Republic, with stations near CERN and throughout the city. Electric bike rental services are also available in Geneva and nearby towns, and some CERN employees use e-bikes for the slightly longer commute from Ferney-Voltaire or Gex.

## Driving & Parking

Parking is available at both CERN sites but can be limited, especially at Meyrin during peak hours, and a **CERN access card** is required for the parking barriers. Many employees living in France commute by car through the border crossing near CERN (Entrance E), which is usually quick but can have delays during rush hour.

A **French motorway vignette** is not needed for local roads in the Pays de Gex area and is only required for motorways further afield. The **Swiss motorway vignette** costs CHF 40 per year and is mandatory for using Swiss motorways. It is available at border crossings, post offices, and petrol stations.

## Regional Trains

The **Leman Express** is the regional train network connecting Geneva to Annemasse and the Annecy corridor, useful if you live south of the border or in towns along the line. **SBB/CFF** (Swiss Federal Railways) operates frequent trains between Geneva Cornavin and Lausanne, as well as connections to the rest of Switzerland. The Geneva station is about 20 minutes from CERN by bus.

If you live further from CERN -- for example in Nyon, Lausanne, or Annemasse -- combining train and bus can be an efficient commute option worth exploring.

## From Geneva Airport

CERN is very close to **Geneva airport** (approximately 5 km), which makes it convenient for international travel. By public transport, take bus 23, 28, or 57 from the airport to Blandonnet, then transfer to tram 18 or bus 68 towards CERN. The total journey takes about 25 to 35 minutes depending on connections. A taxi from the airport to CERN costs approximately **CHF 40-50** and takes about 10 to 15 minutes depending on traffic.
