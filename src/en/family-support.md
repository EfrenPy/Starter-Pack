<h1>Family Support at CERN</h1>

      <div class="alert">
        <strong>⚠️ Important</strong><br>
        <p>Relocating with your family requires early planning. Many CERN support programmes have application windows and eligibility conditions — start the process as soon as you receive your contract.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Relocating with Family</h2>
      <p>CERN provides <strong>relocation support</strong> for employees arriving with their families. Contact the CERN Housing Service and HR department early to understand the assistance available to you. Depending on your contract type, a <strong>settling-in allowance</strong> may be offered as a one-time payment to help cover initial expenses such as deposits, temporary accommodation, and moving costs. The Housing Service can also assist with your housing search, providing listings and advice for both the Swiss and French sides of the border.</p>
      <p>Before arriving, gather all necessary documents — passports, marriage certificates, and birth certificates (translated and apostilled) — and arrange <strong>school enrolment</strong> and health insurance coverage for every family member. The more you prepare in advance, the smoother the transition will be.</p>

      <h2>Spouses &amp; Partners Forum</h2>
      <p>The <strong>CERN Spouses &amp; Partners Forum</strong> is a CERN-supported network that helps the partners and spouses of CERN personnel integrate into life in the Geneva area. The forum organises regular meetings, social events, language courses, and cultural activities throughout the year, and also offers <strong>career advice sessions and workshops</strong> to help partners explore employment and professional development opportunities in Switzerland and France.</p>
      <p>To connect with the forum, visit the CERN Welcome Club website or contact the CERN Staff Association for meeting schedules and registration details.</p>

      <h2>Dual Career Support</h2>
      <p>CERN runs a <strong>Dual Career programme</strong> specifically designed to support the professional lives of partners who relocate to the Geneva area. The programme offers career workshops, CV review sessions, and interview preparation tailored to the local Swiss and French job markets. <strong>Networking events</strong> connect partners with local employers, international organisations, and other professionals in the region.</p>
      <p>Job search resources include access to local job boards, guidance on Swiss and French employment practices, and information about <strong>work permits for non-EU nationals</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Partner Employment</h2>
      <p>Work rights for partners depend on the country of residence and the type of permit held, and the rules differ significantly between Switzerland and France. Partners holding a dependent <strong>Swiss carte de legitimation</strong> may face restrictions on taking up paid employment in Switzerland — check with the Swiss Mission or HR for your specific situation. If you reside in France, partners may benefit from more flexible work authorisation rules, as a <strong>titre de sejour</strong> obtained through the French authorities can allow employment in France.</p>
      <p>Partners can also explore employment at other <strong>international organisations</strong> in Geneva (UN, WHO, ILO, WTO, and others), which may have their own hiring processes for family members of international civil servants.</p>

      <h2>Family Allowances</h2>
      <p>CERN provides <strong>family allowances</strong> including a child allowance for each dependent child, with the amount varying based on the child's age and educational status. <strong>Education grants</strong> are also available for children attending school or university, helping to cover tuition fees and related educational expenses.</p>
      <p>To apply, submit your request through the CERN HR portal — you will need birth certificates, proof of dependency, and educational enrolment documents. Apply promptly after joining CERN, since allowances are generally <strong>not paid retroactively</strong> for extended periods. Keep HR updated if your family situation changes (new child, change in schooling, etc.).</p>

      <h2>Childcare &amp; Parenting</h2>
      <p>CERN does not operate its own creche, but the CERN Staff Association and Welcome Club maintain <strong>up-to-date lists of childcare options</strong> near CERN on both the Swiss and French sides. Parenting networks and baby/toddler groups operate through the CERN Welcome Club, meeting regularly to provide a support network for new parents in the area.</p>
      <p><strong>Family-friendly events</strong> are organised throughout the year, including holiday activities, outings, and workshops for children of various ages. For detailed information on schools and childcare facilities, see the dedicated childcare and schools page on this site.</p>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <p>Connect with the <strong>Spouses Forum</strong> before or immediately after arrival — it is one of the best resources for settling in. Before your partner starts a job search, make sure you understand the <strong>work restrictions</strong> associated with your permit type, as this varies greatly between Switzerland and France.</p>
      <p>Submit your <strong>family allowance applications</strong> as soon as you have the required documents, since delays can cost you. Finally, connect with the <strong>Welcome Club families section</strong>, which organises activities specifically for families with children and is an excellent way to build a social network in the area.</p>
