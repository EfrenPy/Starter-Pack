# Cross-Border Worker (Frontalier) Guide

<p>Cross-border worker rules change frequently. Verify current requirements with your local prefecture and the Swiss authorities before making decisions about residence or insurance.</p>
</div>

A large proportion of CERN employees live in France — particularly in the Pays de Gex — while working on the Swiss side of the border. This arrangement makes you a **frontalier** (cross-border worker), a status that carries specific administrative obligations and choices regarding taxation, health insurance, and residency permits. Understanding these rules early saves time and prevents costly mistakes down the line.

## What Is a Frontalier?

A frontalier is a person who resides in one country and works in another, crossing the border regularly to reach their workplace. In the Geneva region, this typically means living in the French departments of Ain or Haute-Savoie and commuting to CERN's Meyrin or Prevessin sites. The status is formally recognised by both Swiss and French authorities, and it comes with a distinct set of rules regarding **taxation, social security, and health insurance** that differ from those applying to people who both live and work in the same country.

CERN employees are in a somewhat special position because the organisation's international status means that some of the standard frontalier rules — particularly around income taxation — are modified by CERN's Protocol on Privileges and Immunities. Nonetheless, the residence and health insurance aspects still apply, and getting them right from the start is important.

## The G Permit

Non-EU nationals working in Switzerland while residing in France typically need a **Swiss G permit** (cross-border worker permit). However, CERN employees holding a **carte de legitimation** issued by the Swiss DFAE are generally covered by that document instead, which serves as both their work authorisation and identity document in Switzerland. If you do not hold a carte de legitimation — for example, if you are a short-term contractor — check with CERN's Host States Relations service whether a G permit is required in your case.

On the French side, non-EU nationals need a valid **titre de sejour** (residence permit) issued by the local prefecture. The application process requires proof of employment at CERN, proof of French residence, and standard identity documents. Processing times can vary from a few weeks to several months depending on the prefecture, so apply as early as possible after finding your French accommodation.

## Tax Residency for Frontaliers

As a frontalier living in France, your **tax residency** is in France, which means France is where you would normally owe income tax on employment earnings. However, since CERN salaries are exempt from national income tax under the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities, this obligation does not apply to your CERN remuneration. You pay CERN's internal tax instead, and your CERN salary should be declared as exempt income on your French tax return. You must still **file an annual French tax declaration** (even if your only income is from CERN), reporting any non-CERN income such as rental income, investment returns, or a partner's salary.

The **taxe d'habitation** has been phased out for most primary residences in France, but you may still owe **taxe fonciere** if you own property. Local taxes and social contributions in France are separate from income tax and still apply to frontaliers regardless of their CERN status.

## Health Insurance Choice

One of the most important decisions for frontaliers is the **health insurance choice**. CERN employees can choose between CERN's own health insurance scheme (**CHIS**) and the French or Swiss public systems. Frontaliers living in France have historically had the option of joining the French **PUMa** (formerly CMU) or opting for Swiss **LAMal** coverage, but CERN staff covered by CHIS are generally exempt from the mandatory Swiss or French insurance requirement.

If you choose CHIS, it covers you and your family for medical expenses in both Switzerland and France, with a network of recognised providers and reimbursement rates that are detailed in the CHIS rules. If you have a partner who works locally and is not covered by CERN, they will need their own French or Swiss health insurance. Take time to compare the options carefully, as switching later can be complicated and is sometimes restricted by deadlines or waiting periods.

## Daily Commute

The border crossing between France and Switzerland is a daily reality for thousands of frontaliers, and the **peak-hour traffic** around CERN and the nearby customs posts can be significant. The main crossings used by CERN employees are at Meyrin (directly next to CERN), Saint-Genis-Pouilly, and Ferney-Voltaire. During morning and evening rush hours, delays of 10 to 30 minutes are not uncommon, particularly at the Meyrin crossing.

To avoid traffic, many frontaliers adjust their schedule by arriving before 8:00 or after 9:30, or by using the **Prevessin entrance** to CERN, which is on the French side and avoids the border entirely for those living in the Pays de Gex. Cycling is also a practical option for those living within a few kilometres of CERN, with dedicated bike paths along several routes. CERN's flexible working hours and telework policy (up to 40% of working time) can further help reduce commuting stress.

## Administrative Paperwork

As a frontalier, you will need to keep several administrative threads in order simultaneously. On the French side, this includes your titre de sejour (if applicable), registration at the local mairie, and annual tax declarations. On the Swiss side, your carte de legitimation or G permit must remain valid throughout your CERN contract. CERN's **Host States Relations** service is the central point of contact for questions about your administrative status, and they can provide attestation letters that French and Swiss authorities may request.

Keep copies of all documents — contract, carte de legitimation, titre de sejour, insurance certificates, and tax returns — in a single accessible location. Administrative offices on both sides of the border can be slow and sometimes request documents at short notice, so having everything organised saves considerable frustration.
