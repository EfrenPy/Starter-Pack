<h1>Clubs &amp; Social Life at CERN</h1>

      <div class="alert">
        <strong>⚠️ Important</strong><br>
        <p>Some popular sports clubs and courses have limited spots and fill up quickly at the start of each season. Register early and check the Staff Association website regularly for openings.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Staff Association</h2>
      <p>The <strong>CERN Staff Association</strong> is the elected body representing all CERN personnel, advocating for employees' rights, working conditions, and benefits. Beyond representation, it organises and manages a wide range of clubs, activities, and social events throughout the year.</p>
      <p>Membership gives you access to <strong>subsidised club memberships</strong>, group insurance rates, discounts at local businesses, and various perks. The Staff Association offices are in Building 504 on the Meyrin site — visit their website or drop by for information on all available activities.</p>

      <h2>Welcome Club</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Welcome Club</strong> is specifically designed for newcomers to CERN and their families, and it is one of the best ways to start building your social network. It brings members together through regular coffee mornings, cultural outings, day trips to Swiss and French destinations, and seasonal celebrations. The club also offers affordable <strong>French classes and conversation groups</strong>, particularly useful for partners who may not work at CERN.</p>
      <p>For families with young children, the Welcome Club organises <strong>playgroups</strong> where children and parents can socialise together. To join, visit the Welcome Club website or attend one of their regular welcome events — membership is open to all CERN personnel and their families.</p>

      <h2>Sports Clubs</h2>
      <p>CERN boasts <strong>more than 70 sports clubs</strong> and courses covering a huge range of activities — from football, running, and swimming to skiing, tennis, yoga, martial arts, and cycling. The CERN fitness centre offers <strong>subsidised access</strong> for all personnel and is equipped with modern machines, free weights, and group class studios. Several clubs also field competitive teams that participate in local and regional leagues.</p>
      <p>You can browse the full list of sports clubs on the Staff Association website. Most have an annual membership fee (typically modest) and <strong>welcome all skill levels</strong>, so do not be put off if you are a beginner.</p>

      <h2>Cultural Clubs</h2>
      <p>The cultural scene at CERN is surprisingly vibrant. The <strong>music club, choir, and various bands</strong> bring together musicians of all levels, with concerts and jam sessions held throughout the year. Photography and art clubs organise exhibitions, workshops, and outings, while <strong>wine-tasting clubs and cooking groups</strong> let you explore Swiss, French, and international cuisine with fellow enthusiasts.</p>
      <p>If performing arts are more your thing, film clubs, theatre groups, and <strong>dance classes</strong> (salsa, tango, swing, and more) provide creative outlets and entertainment. Board game nights, book clubs, and other hobby groups also meet regularly — check the Staff Association directory for the full list.</p>

      <h2>National Communities</h2>
      <p>Many nationalities have their own <strong>informal communities</strong> at CERN — Spanish, Italian, Greek, German, Portuguese, Indian, and many others. These groups organise celebrations for national holidays, traditional food events, and cultural presentations throughout the year, and they provide <strong>practical advice</strong> for compatriots on everything from finding a flat to navigating local bureaucracy in your native language.</p>
      <p>To find your community, ask colleagues from your country, check the CERN <strong>e-groups mailing lists</strong>, or look for your national group on social media and messaging platforms.</p>

      <h2>Outdoor Activities</h2>
      <p>The Geneva region is a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts. The <strong>Jura mountains and the Alps</strong> are at your doorstep, with hundreds of marked trails ranging from easy lakeside walks to challenging alpine routes. For skiing, the closest areas include Col de la Faucille and Crozet in the Jura (30 minutes by car), while major resorts like <strong>Chamonix, Verbier, and Flaine</strong> are within one to two hours.</p>
      <p><strong>Lake Geneva</strong> offers swimming, sailing, paddle boarding, and lakeside relaxation at free, well-maintained public beaches. The cycling infrastructure in both Switzerland and France is excellent, and the CERN cycling club organises regular group rides for all levels. The Staff Association also arranges group excursions — ski weekends, hiking trips, and cultural outings — at <strong>subsidised prices</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Social Events</h2>
      <p>CERN's social calendar features several highlights. The <strong>Hardronic Festival</strong> is the annual music festival organised by the Staff Association, with live bands, food stalls, and a lively atmosphere right on the CERN site. During the summer months, departmental and group <strong>barbecues</strong> are a beloved tradition, and each December the annual <strong>Christmas market</strong> brings seasonal treats, handmade crafts, and festive cheer to the Meyrin site.</p>
      <p>CERN also regularly hosts <strong>public lectures, open days, and science exhibitions</strong> — excellent opportunities to invite family and friends to discover CERN. Informal <strong>science cafes</strong> at local venues around Geneva, organised by CERN outreach, are open to everyone and a great way to meet people beyond the CERN bubble.</p>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <p>The most up-to-date list of all clubs, activities, and events is maintained on the <strong>Staff Association website</strong> — bookmark it and check regularly. Welcome sessions and newcomer events are organised frequently and are the easiest way to meet people and learn what is available.</p>
      <p>Popular sports clubs and courses fill up fast, especially at the start of the academic year in September, so <strong>register as soon as enrollment opens</strong>. Joining clubs and attending social events is one of the best ways to build a strong personal and professional network at CERN — do not hesitate to try something new.</p>
