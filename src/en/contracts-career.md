# Contracts & Career at CERN

<div class="alert">
<strong>⚠️ Disclaimer</strong><br>
<p>This page is for general informational purposes only. Always consult CERN HR or the Staff Association for up-to-date information on your contractual situation.</p>

## Contract Types

CERN offers several contract types, each with different conditions and durations. **Staff** contracts -- either indefinite or limited duration -- are the most stable, with full access to all benefits. **Fellows** hold limited-duration contracts of up to 3 years, aimed at post-doctoral or early-career professionals. **Doctoral students** participate in a programme of up to 3 years while remaining enrolled at a home university.

In addition, **associates** are personnel sent by member state institutes to work on specific CERN projects, and **users** are affiliated researchers who use CERN facilities but are not direct employees. Each category carries different rights, benefits, and administrative obligations.

## Staff Contracts

Staff contracts typically start as **limited duration (LD)**, which can be extended up to a maximum of 8 years in total. During this period, you may apply for conversion to an **indefinite duration** contract, though this depends on your performance and CERN's operational needs.

CERN staff are classified into **grades** (reflecting level of responsibility) and **steps** (reflecting experience), with step advancement occurring annually. Several career paths exist -- technical, administrative, and research -- each with its own progression criteria.

## Fellowship Programme

The CERN Fellowship Programme targets **post-doctoral or early-career professionals** in physics, engineering, computing, or other relevant disciplines. Contracts last a maximum of **3 years** and cannot be extended beyond this limit. The selection process is highly competitive, with periodic calls and evaluation committees.

It is important to know that the fellowship is a **one-time opportunity** -- you cannot re-apply for the same programme after completing it. Fellows receive a monthly stipend plus allowances for installation, travel, and, where applicable, family expenses.

## Doctoral Students

The **CERN Doctoral Student programme** allows doctoral research to be carried out at CERN facilities for a maximum of 3 years. Students must remain enrolled at their home university throughout the entire period. Doctoral students receive a monthly stipend and allowances, though the conditions differ from those of fellows.

## Extension Rules

Limited duration staff contracts are reviewed at the **5-year mark**, at which point extension or conversion to an indefinite contract depends on performance and CERN's needs. Fellowship contracts, by contrast, **cannot be extended beyond 3 years** in total -- there are no exceptions to this rule.

Rules also exist on the **maximum cumulative duration** of employment at CERN under different contract types. Additionally, mandatory gaps may be required between certain consecutive contract types, which is worth keeping in mind when planning your career trajectory.

## Career Development

All staff participate in the annual **MARS** (Merit Appraisal and Recognition of Staff) review system, which evaluates performance and sets objectives for the coming year. CERN also offers extensive training opportunities through the **Learning Hub**, covering technical skills, languages, and professional development.

**Internal mobility** between departments and projects is actively encouraged to broaden experience and skills. Promotion criteria include performance, competencies, experience, and availability of positions at higher grades. CERN also provides **career counselling** services to help staff plan their professional path.

## Leaving CERN

When your time at CERN comes to an end, **notice periods** vary by contract type and seniority -- check your contract or consult HR for exact timelines. End-of-contract procedures include returning equipment, closing accounts, completing pension formalities, and updating your permits. Depending on your contract type and length of service, you may be entitled to **end-of-contract indemnities**.

Your **pension options** depend on your years of service (see the Pension Fund page for details). Expatriate staff may also be entitled to a **repatriation grant** at the end of their contract. Finally, CERN issues a **certificate of employment** detailing your position and period of service, which is useful for future job applications.

## Practical Tips

Make sure you understand your **contract type and its duration limits** from day one. If you are a fellow or doctoral student, plan ahead for the end of your contract well in advance. Take advantage of CERN's **career counselling services** to map out your professional path, and keep careful track of your MARS reviews and professional achievements throughout your career.
