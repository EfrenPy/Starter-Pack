# CERN Benefits & Perks

<div class="alert">
<strong>💡 Tip</strong><br>
<p>Benefit eligibility varies by contract type. Staff members have access to the full range, while fellows and associates may have limited entitlements. Check with HR for your specific situation.</p>
</div>

Beyond the salary itself, CERN offers a range of benefits, allowances, and perks that can significantly improve your quality of life and financial situation. Some of these — like the tax-free purchase scheme — are unique to international organisations and represent genuine savings compared to local retail prices. Understanding what is available helps you take full advantage from the start of your contract.

## Recreation Fund

The CERN **Staff Association** manages a recreation fund that finances a wide variety of clubs, activities, and social events. Through this fund, employees have access to more than 70 activity clubs covering sports (football, tennis, climbing, running, sailing, skiing), cultural activities (photography, music, art, theatre), and social groups (wine tasting, cooking, board games). Annual membership fees for most clubs are very modest, typically ranging from CHF 20 to CHF 100, and the recreation fund subsidises equipment, venue hire, and instructor costs.

The Staff Association also organises larger events throughout the year, including the **CERN Fete**, seasonal parties, family outings, and group trips to nearby destinations. These events are open to all CERN personnel and their families and are an excellent way to socialise outside of work.

## Tax-Free Purchases

CERN employees holding a **carte de legitimation** can make tax-free purchases on certain high-value items through CERN's procurement system, bypassing the Swiss TVA (currently **8.1%**) and saving a significant amount. The most common categories include **vehicles** (see the Vehicles and Green Plates page for details), **electronics** (computers, phones, cameras), and **household appliances**. The exact items and conditions are governed by the Swiss DFAE rules and CERN administrative circulars.

To make a tax-free purchase, you submit a request through the CERN procurement office with details of the item and the supplier. The office verifies your eligibility and processes the order with the VAT exemption applied. There are **annual limits** on the value of tax-free purchases, and the items must be for personal use — reselling tax-free goods is prohibited and can result in loss of privileges. Electronics from Apple, Dell, and other manufacturers are popular choices, as the savings can amount to several hundred francs on a single purchase.

## Corporate Discounts

CERN and the Staff Association have negotiated **corporate discounts** with a range of local and international companies. These typically include reduced prices on electronics (Apple, Dell, HP, Lenovo), discounts at selected retailers and service providers, and preferential rates for ski passes, fitness centres, and cultural venues. The exact list changes periodically, so check the Staff Association website or CERN Bulletin for current offers.

**Ski pass discounts** are particularly popular given CERN's proximity to the Alps. Group purchases organised through the Staff Association often provide 10 to 30 percent savings on season passes for major resorts like Chamonix, Flaine, and Portes du Soleil. Phone plan discounts from Swiss providers like Salt and Swisscom are also commonly available.

## CERN Canteen and Meals

CERN operates three main restaurants — **R1** and **R3** on the Meyrin site, and **R2** on the Prevessin site — along with several cafeterias and coffee corners. Meals are **subsidised** by CERN, making them significantly cheaper than eating out at local restaurants. A typical lunch with a main course, salad or dessert, and a drink costs between EUR 8 and EUR 15. Payment is made with your CERN badge, which is linked to a pre-paid balance that you can top up online or at terminals on site.

The restaurants offer a variety of options including daily specials, vegetarian and vegan dishes, pasta bars, grills, and salad bars. The quality and variety are generally good for institutional catering, and the social aspect of lunch at CERN is an important part of workplace culture — many collaborations and friendships start over a shared meal.

## Travel and Conference Allowances

CERN supports **professional travel** for conferences, workshops, collaboration meetings, and training. Travel costs — including flights, train tickets, accommodation, and a daily subsistence allowance — are covered by your group's or experiment's budget, subject to supervisor approval. The daily subsistence allowance varies by destination and is intended to cover meals and incidental expenses during the trip.

Travel requests are submitted through the **EDH system**, and you should book well in advance to take advantage of lower fares. CERN has negotiated rates with several travel agencies and hotel chains, and the travel office can assist with bookings and logistics. For early-career researchers, attending international conferences is an important part of professional development and networking, so discuss travel opportunities with your supervisor early in your contract.

## Education Grant

CERN provides an **education grant** for dependent children of staff members, contributing towards tuition fees for primary, secondary, and post-secondary education. The grant covers a portion of school fees and is calculated based on actual costs up to an annual ceiling set by CERN's rules. International schools in the Geneva area can be expensive — annual fees at schools like the International School of Geneva or the Geneva English School range from CHF 15,000 to CHF 30,000 — so the education grant represents a meaningful financial benefit for families.

To claim the education grant, submit an application through the HR portal with proof of enrolment and fee invoices. The grant is typically paid annually or per school term, and you must reapply each academic year. Public schools in both Switzerland and France are free, but some families prefer international schools for continuity of curriculum, English-language instruction, or the International Baccalaureate programme.

## Relocation Allowance

Depending on your contract type and country of origin, CERN may provide a **relocation allowance** to help cover the costs of moving to the Geneva area. This one-time payment is intended to offset expenses such as shipping personal belongings, temporary accommodation, and other settling-in costs. The amount varies by contract category and family status — staff members with families typically receive a higher allowance than single employees.

The relocation allowance is separate from the **installation indemnity**, which covers the initial expenses of setting up in a new country (such as deposits and first-month rent). Both are subject to specific eligibility conditions, so check with HR during your onboarding to understand exactly what financial support is available to you.
