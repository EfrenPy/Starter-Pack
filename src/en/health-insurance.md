# Health Insurance at CERN

<div class="alert">
<strong>⚠️ Important</strong><br>
<p>Making the wrong choice or missing a deadline on health insurance can be costly and irreversible. Read this page carefully and act within the required timeframes.</p>
</div>

## CHIS: Your Primary Coverage

The **CERN Health Insurance Scheme (CHIS)** is your primary health coverage. All CERN employees are enrolled automatically upon joining, and the scheme covers medical expenses, hospitalisation, dental care (partial), maternity, and emergency treatment in Switzerland, France, and abroad.

Your registered family members (spouse, children) can also be covered under CHIS -- register them through the CERN HR department as soon as possible after your arrival. It is important to understand that CHIS is **not a state insurance**. It is CERN's own scheme, managed independently from both the Swiss and French national systems.

## If You Live in Switzerland

CERN staff holding a **carte de legitimation** are exempt from the Swiss mandatory health insurance known as **LAMal**. You do not need to enrol in a Swiss health insurance plan. If your spouse or family members do not hold CERN status and work in Switzerland, however, they may need their own LAMal coverage -- check with the cantonal office (Office cantonal de l'assurance maladie, Geneva) to confirm.

In short, if you and your family are fully covered by CHIS and nobody works outside CERN in Switzerland, **no additional insurance is required**. That said, you may voluntarily opt into LAMal for additional coverage if you wish. Compare premiums at priminfo.admin.ch before deciding.

## If You Live in France (Cross-border — Critical)

<div class="alert">
<strong>⚠️</strong>
<p>If you live in France, you must make a health insurance choice within 3 months of registering your residence. This choice is normally irreversible.</p>
</div>

### The Droit d'Option

As a cross-border worker (frontalier) living in France and working at CERN, you have the right to choose between three health coverage options:

- **Option A -- CHIS only:** Keep your CERN insurance as your sole coverage. No affiliation with the French system. Simplest option for most CERN employees.
- **Option B -- French system (CMU/PUMA):** Affiliate with the French social security system via CPAM (Caisse Primaire d'Assurance Maladie). You would pay contributions to URSSAF based on your income. This provides access to the full French healthcare network.
- **Option C -- Swiss LAMal:** Enrol in Swiss mandatory health insurance at the frontalier rate. Provides coverage in both Switzerland and France but involves Swiss premium payments.

### Deadline and Process

You have **3 months** from the date you register your residence in France (at the mairie) to exercise your droit d'option. If you miss this deadline, you may be automatically assigned to the French system. Once you make your choice, it is **normally permanent** for as long as you remain in the same situation -- same employer, same country of residence.

If you choose CHIS only (Option A), you may need an **S1 form** to prove you have health coverage. CERN's HR department can help you obtain the necessary documentation. Submit your choice to the **CPAM de l'Ain** (if you live in the Pays de Gex area) or the relevant CPAM for your department.

## CHIS Reimbursement: How It Works

To get reimbursed, submit your claims through the **CHIS online portal** or by sending paper forms to the CHIS office at CERN. Keep all medical receipts, prescriptions, and invoices, as you will need to attach them to your claim.

CHIS typically reimburses **80-90%** of eligible costs for most services. Check the CHIS schedule of benefits for exact rates. For emergencies abroad, CHIS provides **worldwide coverage** -- keep your CHIS card with you when travelling and contact the CHIS office for pre-authorisation if possible.
