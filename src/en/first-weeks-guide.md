<h1>First Weeks Guide at CERN</h1>
<div class="alert">
<strong>💡 Tip</strong><br>
<p>This timeline is flexible. Priorities may vary depending on your contract type and personal situation.</p>
</div>
<p>Starting at CERN can feel overwhelming with so many administrative and personal tasks to handle at once. This guide breaks down the first four weeks into manageable steps so you can settle in smoothly and focus on what matters most — your work and your new life near Geneva.</p>

<h2>Day 1: Arrival &amp; Essentials</h2>
<p>Your very first day is all about getting the basics in place so you can access the site and start working.</p>
<p>The first stop is the <strong>Users Office in Building 55</strong>, where you collect your CERN access badge. Bring your passport or national ID card along with your contract documentation. This badge grants you entry to the site and doubles as a payment method in CERN restaurants and services. Once you have it, you must complete the <strong>Level 1 safety course</strong>, which covers basic safety rules, emergency procedures, and radiation protection awareness. The course is typically scheduled on your first day or within the first few days, and you cannot work independently on site until it is done.</p>
<p>You should also visit the <strong>CERN ServiceDesk</strong> (also in Building 55) to activate your computing account, set up your email, and obtain credentials for essential tools like EDMS, Indico, and the CERN network. Keep in mind that your account may take 24-48 hours to become fully active across all systems. Your supervisor or a colleague will round out the day with a tour of your building, introducing you to your team and pointing out key locations such as the nearest coffee corner, printers, meeting rooms, and emergency exits.</p>

<h2>Week 1: Setting Up Your Daily Life</h2>
<p>With site access and IT sorted, the first week is the right time to take care of practical essentials outside of work.</p>
<p>A <strong>local bank account</strong> makes life much easier for paying rent and bills. <strong>UBS</strong> has a branch on the CERN Meyrin site (Building 504), which is the most convenient option. If you live in France, <strong>Credit Agricole</strong> in nearby towns like St-Genis-Pouilly or Ferney-Voltaire is a popular choice, and many CERN employees also use digital banks like Wise or Revolut as a complement. You will also want a <strong>local phone number</strong> for administrative registrations and day-to-day communication. For a Swiss number, <strong>Swisscom</strong> and <strong>Salt</strong> are the main providers with good coverage around CERN; if you live in France, <strong>Free Mobile</strong> offers very competitive plans with roaming included in Switzerland.</p>
<p>CERN has three main restaurants — <strong>R1</strong> and <strong>R3</strong> on the Meyrin site, and <strong>R2</strong> on the Prevessin site — where lunch menus typically cost EUR 8-15 and you can pay with your CERN badge. Try them all during your first week to find your favourite. Take some time to explore <strong>Meyrin</strong> (on the Swiss side) and <strong>St-Genis-Pouilly</strong> (on the French side) as well, since both have supermarkets, pharmacies, and local shops you will use regularly. Knowing your surroundings early on saves time later.</p>

<h2>Week 2: Housing &amp; Transport</h2>
<p>If you are staying in the CERN hostel temporarily, the second week is a good time to start planning your longer-term living situation.</p>
<p>Begin looking for a flat or shared housing through the CERN Market, local agencies, and websites like Immobilier.ch (Switzerland) or Leboncoin.fr and SeLoger.com (France). The housing market near CERN moves fast, so starting early is important. Once you have a sense of where you will live, look into public transport options — the <strong>TPG unireso</strong> pass covers the Geneva canton, while the <strong>Leman Pass</strong> works well if you commute across the French-Swiss border. CERN also provides shuttle buses between the Meyrin and Prevessin sites.</p>
<p>Those living in Switzerland must <strong>register at their local commune within 14 days</strong> of moving in, bringing a passport, CERN legitimation card, rental contract, and proof of health insurance. This mandatory step gives you your Swiss residence permit. If you have already found an apartment, arrange electricity, internet, and any other utilities at this stage. In Switzerland, electricity providers vary by commune, and Swisscom, Sunrise, and Salt are common choices for internet. In France, Free, Orange, and SFR offer home internet packages.</p>

<h2>Weeks 3-4: Administrative Tasks &amp; Settling In</h2>
<p>By the third and fourth week, you should have the essentials in place. Now it is time to wrap up the remaining administrative tasks and start enjoying your new environment.</p>
<p>Apply for your <strong>carte de legitimation</strong> — the CERN identity document recognised by Swiss and French authorities — through the CERN Admin e-Guide. You also need to make your <strong>health insurance choice</strong> between CERN's CHIS, Swiss LAMal, or French CMU/PUMA depending on your residence. These decisions have deadlines, so do not postpone them. On the personal side, a weekend spent visiting <strong>Geneva old town</strong>, walking along <strong>Lake Geneva</strong>, or hiking up <strong>Mont Saleve</strong> for panoramic views of the Alps will help you feel at home in the region.</p>
<p>The <strong>Welcome Club</strong> organises regular social events, excursions, and cultural activities for newcomers, and CERN has dozens of <strong>clubs and associations</strong> covering everything from football and climbing to photography and wine tasting — a great way to meet people outside your work group. By this point you should have a good handle on your daily commute, lunch habits, and work environment, so focus on building relationships with your colleagues, understanding your project goals, and making the most of the resources CERN offers, from technical training to language courses.</p>
<p>The first month at CERN is a busy period, but taking it step by step makes it manageable. Do not hesitate to ask your colleagues or the Users Office for help — everyone has been through this process and is happy to share advice.</p>
