<h1>First Weeks Guide at CERN</h1>

      <div class="alert">
        <strong>💡 Tip</strong><br>
        <p>This timeline is flexible. Priorities may vary depending on your contract type and personal situation.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Starting at CERN can feel overwhelming with so many administrative and personal tasks to handle at once. This guide breaks down the first four weeks into manageable steps so you can settle in smoothly and focus on what matters most — your work and your new life near Geneva.</p>

      <h2>Day 1: Arrival &amp; Essentials</h2>

      <p>Your very first day is all about getting the basics in place so you can access the site and start working.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Badge pickup at Building 55:</strong> Head to the Users Office in Building 55 to collect your CERN access badge. Bring your passport or national ID card and your contract documentation. The badge grants you access to the site and is also used for payments at CERN restaurants and services.</li>
        <li><strong>Mandatory safety briefing (Level 1):</strong> All newcomers must complete the Level 1 safety course, which covers basic safety rules, emergency procedures, and radiation protection awareness. This is typically scheduled on your first day or within the first few days. You cannot work independently on site until this is done.</li>
        <li><strong>IT account activation at the ServiceDesk:</strong> Visit the CERN ServiceDesk (Building 55) to activate your computing account, set up your email, and get credentials for essential tools like EDMS, Indico, and the CERN network. Your account may take up to 24-48 hours to become fully active across all systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Building tour with your supervisor:</strong> Your supervisor or a colleague will show you around your building, introduce you to your team, and point out key locations — the nearest coffee corner, printers, meeting rooms, and emergency exits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Week 1: Setting Up Your Daily Life</h2>

      <p>With site access and IT sorted, the first week is the right time to take care of practical essentials outside of work.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Open a bank account:</strong> A local bank account makes life much easier for paying rent and bills. <strong>UBS</strong> has a branch on the CERN Meyrin site (Building 504), which is the most convenient option. If you live in France, <strong>Credit Agricole</strong> in nearby towns like St-Genis-Pouilly or Ferney-Voltaire is a popular choice. Many CERN employees also use digital banks like Wise or Revolut as a complement.</li>
        <li><strong>Get a phone and SIM card:</strong> For a Swiss number, <strong>Swisscom</strong> and <strong>Salt</strong> are the main providers with good coverage around CERN. If you live in France, <strong>Free Mobile</strong> offers very competitive plans with roaming included in Switzerland. Having a local number is important for administrative registrations and day-to-day communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Explore campus restaurants:</strong> CERN has three main restaurants — <strong>R1</strong> and <strong>R3</strong> on the Meyrin site, and <strong>R2</strong> on the Prevessin site. Lunch menus typically cost EUR 8-15 and you can pay with your CERN badge. Try them all during your first week to find your favourite.</li>
        <li><strong>Get to know the neighbourhood:</strong> Take some time to explore <strong>Meyrin</strong> (on the Swiss side) and <strong>St-Genis-Pouilly</strong> (on the French side). Both have supermarkets, pharmacies, and local shops you will use regularly. Knowing your surroundings early on will save you time later.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Week 2: Housing &amp; Transport</h2>

      <p>If you are staying in the CERN hostel temporarily, the second week is a good time to start planning your longer-term living situation.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start your housing search:</strong> If you are in CERN temporary accommodation, begin looking for a flat or shared housing. Check the CERN Market, local agencies, and websites like Immobilier.ch (Switzerland) or Leboncoin.fr and SeLoger.com (France). The housing market near CERN moves fast, so start early.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply for a transport card:</strong> Public transport in the Geneva area is well-connected. Look into the <strong>TPG unireso</strong> pass for the Geneva canton or the <strong>Leman Pass</strong> if you commute across the French-Swiss border. CERN also provides shuttle buses between the Meyrin and Prevessin sites.</li>
        <li><strong>Register with your commune (Switzerland):</strong> If you live in Switzerland, you must register at your local commune within <strong>14 days</strong> of moving in. Bring your passport, CERN legitimation card, rental contract, and proof of health insurance. This step is mandatory and gives you your Swiss residence permit.</li>
        <li><strong>Set up utilities:</strong> If you have found an apartment, arrange electricity, internet, and any other utilities. In Switzerland, electricity providers vary by commune. For internet, Swisscom, Sunrise, and Salt are common choices. In France, Free, Orange, and SFR offer home internet packages.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Weeks 3-4: Administrative Tasks &amp; Settling In</h2>

      <p>By the third and fourth week, you should have the essentials in place. Now it is time to wrap up the remaining administrative tasks and start enjoying your new environment.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Complete administrative formalities:</strong> Apply for your <strong>carte de legitimation</strong> (CERN identity document recognised by Swiss and French authorities) through the CERN Admin e-Guide. Make your <strong>health insurance choice</strong> — CERN's CHIS, Swiss LAMal, or French CMU/PUMA depending on your residence. These decisions have deadlines, so do not postpone them.</li>
        <li><strong>Explore the area:</strong> Take a weekend to visit <strong>Geneva old town</strong>, walk along <strong>Lake Geneva</strong>, or hike up <strong>Mont Saleve</strong> for panoramic views of the Alps and the city. The region is full of outdoor activities, cultural events, and neighbouring towns worth exploring.</li>
        <li><strong>Join the CERN Welcome Club or staff activities:</strong> The <strong>Welcome Club</strong> organises regular social events, excursions, and cultural activities for newcomers. CERN also has dozens of <strong>clubs and associations</strong> — from sports like football and climbing to hobbies like photography and wine tasting. It is a great way to meet people outside your work group.</li>
        <li><strong>Settle into your work routine:</strong> By now you should have a good handle on your daily commute, lunch habits, and work environment. Focus on building relationships with your colleagues, understanding your project goals, and making the most of the resources CERN offers — from technical training to language courses.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The first month at CERN is a busy period, but taking it step by step makes it manageable. Do not hesitate to ask your colleagues or the Users Office for help — everyone has been through this process and is happy to share advice.</p>
