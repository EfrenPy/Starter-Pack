<h1>Relocation &amp; Moving Guide</h1>
<div class="alert">
<strong>💡 Tip</strong><br>
<p>Get quotes from international movers at least 6 weeks before your departure. Customs clearance for personal belongings can add days to the delivery timeline.</p>
</div>
<p>Moving to the Geneva area for a position at CERN involves more than just booking a flight. Whether you are shipping a household across continents or arriving with a single suitcase, understanding the logistics of international relocation helps you plan your budget, avoid surprises at customs, and settle into your new home more quickly.</p>
<h2>Shipping Personal Belongings</h2>
<p>For an international move, most people use a <strong>professional moving company</strong> that handles packing, shipping, customs documentation, and delivery. Get quotes from at least three companies, and check whether CERN has any negotiated rates or recommended movers — the Staff Association and the CERN Market forum sometimes have suggestions from recent arrivals. Sea freight is the most cost-effective option for large shipments but can take 4 to 8 weeks depending on the origin, while air freight is faster but significantly more expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Customs clearance</strong> for personal effects entering Switzerland is generally straightforward if you can demonstrate that the goods are for personal use and have been in your possession for at least six months. You will need to provide an inventory list, your passport, and your CERN carte de legitimation or employment attestation. Goods imported within your household move are usually exempt from duty and VAT. If you are moving to the French side, French customs rules are similar for EU citizens, but non-EU nationals should check specific requirements with their moving company.</p>
<h2>Housing Timeline</h2>
<p>The transition from temporary to permanent housing typically takes <strong>two to six weeks</strong>, depending on market availability and how flexible you are with location and budget. During your first days, you will likely stay in the CERN hostel or a short-term rental while you search for a flat. The housing market near CERN is competitive, with high demand from international organisations and local employers, so be prepared to visit several properties and make decisions quickly.</p>
<p>Rental contracts in both Switzerland and France typically require a <strong>deposit</strong> equivalent to one to three months' rent, proof of employment or income, and sometimes a guarantee from your employer or a rental insurance (such as SwissCaution in Switzerland). CERN can provide salary attestation letters to support your application. Lease terms are generally one year with automatic renewal, and notice periods range from one to three months depending on the country and contract type.</p>
<h2>Furnished vs Unfurnished Rentals</h2>
<p><strong>Furnished apartments</strong> are more common in Switzerland than in France and are a practical choice if you do not want to invest in furniture for a potentially short stay. They come equipped with the essentials — bed, table, chairs, kitchen appliances, and sometimes linens — but tend to cost 10 to 20 percent more than unfurnished equivalents. For stays of less than two years, furnished rental is often the most sensible option.</p>
<p>If you choose an <strong>unfurnished rental</strong>, you will need to furnish it yourself. <strong>IKEA</strong> in Vernier (a few minutes from CERN) is the go-to option for affordable new furniture, while <strong>Conforama</strong> and <strong>Maisons du Monde</strong> offer alternatives at various price points. For second-hand finds, the <strong>CERN Market</strong> (an internal classified ads platform) and local <strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong> groups are excellent sources — departing CERN employees frequently sell entire household setups at very reasonable prices. Charity shops (Emmaus, Caritas) on both sides of the border also carry furniture and household items.</p>
<h2>Storage Solutions</h2>
<p>If your belongings arrive before your permanent apartment is ready, or if you need to store items you cannot fit in a smaller temporary space, several <strong>self-storage facilities</strong> operate in the Geneva area. Companies like Zebrabox, MyPlace, and Shurgard have locations in Geneva and the surrounding towns with units ranging from 1 to 20 square metres. Monthly costs start at around CHF 50 for a small locker and go up depending on size and location. On the French side, storage tends to be slightly cheaper, with facilities in Thoiry, Saint-Genis-Pouilly, and Ferney-Voltaire.</p>
<p>Some international moving companies also offer <strong>temporary storage</strong> as part of their relocation package, keeping your shipment in their warehouse until you are ready for delivery. This can be convenient but check the costs, as warehouse storage fees can add up if the delay extends beyond a few weeks.</p>
<h2>Postal Address &amp; Mail</h2>
<p>Setting up a reliable postal address is important for receiving official documents, bank correspondence, and packages. In <strong>Switzerland</strong>, your commune will provide you with a mailbox as part of your residence registration, and La Poste (Swiss Post) handles deliveries. If you move within Switzerland, you can set up a mail redirect for a fee. In <strong>France</strong>, your mailbox should be clearly labelled with your name, and La Poste (French Post) delivers to your registered address.</p>
<p>If you are between addresses — for example, staying in the CERN hostel while searching for a flat — you can use CERN's internal mail system to receive some correspondence at your office (Building and office number), though this is not suitable for official administrative mail. A <strong>PO Box</strong> (boite postale) at a local post office is another option for bridging the gap until you have a permanent address.</p>
