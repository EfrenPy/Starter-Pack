# Currency & Money

<div class="alert">
<strong>💡 Tip</strong><br>
<p>CERN salary is paid in Swiss francs. If you live in France, setting up an efficient currency conversion method can save you hundreds of euros per year.</p>

## The CHF/EUR Reality

One of the first things you will notice after arriving at CERN is that your salary lands in **Swiss francs (CHF)**, but a large part of your life may run on **euros (EUR)**. If you settle in the Pays de Gex or anywhere on the French side, rent, groceries, and most day-to-day spending happen in euros. Stay on the Swiss side and nearly everything is in francs. The exchange rate between the two currencies moves constantly, and over the course of a year those fluctuations can quietly eat into your budget -- or work in your favour, if you pay attention.

## Multi-Currency Accounts

The tool that most CERN newcomers set up within their first weeks is a multi-currency account. **Wise** (formerly TransferWise), **Revolut**, and **N26** all let you hold CHF and EUR side by side, convert at close-to-interbank rates, and pay in either currency with minimal fees. For cross-border life, these services are close to indispensable.

Traditional banks like **UBS** or **Credit Agricole** offer CHF/EUR accounts too, but their spreads and conversion fees tend to be noticeably worse. Most people end up using a digital bank as a day-to-day currency tool alongside a main Swiss or French account for salary deposits and direct debits.

## ATM & Card Payments

Card acceptance differs slightly on each side of the border. In Switzerland, **Maestro and debit cards** work almost everywhere -- shops, restaurants, supermarkets. In France, **Visa and Mastercard debit** cards are the norm. Credit cards will technically work for cash withdrawals, but the fees are steep enough that it is never worth doing.

You will also find that many French supermarkets near the border accept CHF, which sounds convenient until you realise they give change in EUR at a poor rate -- not a strategy for currency conversion. Watch out, too, for **dynamic currency conversion** at some border-area ATMs: it looks like a helpful option, but the markup is usually significant. The simple rule is to always pay or withdraw in the **local currency** -- CHF in Switzerland, EUR in France -- and let your own bank or multi-currency app handle the conversion.

## Exchange Rate Tips

Apps like **XE** or **Wise** make it easy to track the CHF/EUR rate day to day. Rather than converting small amounts whenever you need cash, it pays to batch your conversions and move a larger sum when the rate looks good. Most currency apps let you set **rate alerts**, so you get a notification the moment the exchange rate hits a level you are happy with.

Over the past several years the rate has moved between roughly **0.92 and 1.10 EUR per CHF**. A few centimes' difference might seem trivial, but it compounds fast on recurring costs like rent -- over twelve months, timing your conversions well can make a real difference.

## Budget Considerations

Housing and groceries on the French side are typically **30 to 40% cheaper** than in Geneva, which is a big part of why so many CERN employees choose to live across the border. The classic approach is straightforward: receive your salary in CHF, convert what you need to EUR for French expenses, and keep the rest in francs for Swiss spending or savings.

How much you spend each month depends heavily on your situation, but **rent** is almost always the largest line item, followed by **health insurance** and **food**. Aligning your currency conversions with your monthly expense cycle -- converting once or twice around the time bills are due -- helps you dodge unnecessary fees and gives you a better shot at catching a favourable rate.
