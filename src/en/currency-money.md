<h1>Currency &amp; Money</h1>

      <div class="alert">
        <strong>💡 Tip</strong><br>
        <p>CERN salary is paid in Swiss francs. If you live in France, setting up an efficient currency conversion method can save you hundreds of euros per year.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The CHF/EUR Reality</h2>
      <p>Your CERN salary is paid in <strong>Swiss francs (CHF)</strong>. If you live in France -- particularly in the Pays de Gex area -- most of your daily expenses will be in <strong>euros (EUR)</strong>. If you live on the Swiss side, nearly everything is in CHF. The exchange rate between the two currencies fluctuates regularly and can have a significant impact on your monthly budget. Understanding how to manage two currencies efficiently is essential for anyone working at CERN and living near the border.</p>

      <h2>Multi-Currency Accounts</h2>
      <p>Services like <strong>Wise</strong> (formerly TransferWise), <strong>Revolut</strong>, and <strong>N26</strong> offer multi-currency accounts with competitive exchange rates. These platforms allow you to hold both CHF and EUR simultaneously, convert between them at interbank rates, and pay in either currency with minimal fees. Most CERN newcomers consider these services essential for cross-border living.</p>
      <p>Traditional banks such as <strong>UBS</strong> and <strong>Credit Agricole</strong> also offer CHF/EUR accounts, but their exchange rates and conversion fees are typically less favourable. Digital banks are best used as a complement to your main Swiss or French bank account for everyday currency management.</p>

      <h2>ATM &amp; Card Payments</h2>
      <p>In Switzerland, <strong>Maestro and debit cards</strong> are widely accepted at shops, restaurants, and supermarkets. In France, <strong>Visa and Mastercard debit</strong> cards are the standard. Avoid using credit cards for cash withdrawals, as the fees are typically very high.</p>
      <p>Many French supermarkets near the border accept CHF as payment, but they give change in EUR at unfavourable exchange rates -- this is not a good way to convert currency. Some ATMs in the border area offer <strong>dynamic currency conversion</strong>, which may seem convenient but usually includes a markup. Always choose to pay or withdraw in the <strong>local currency</strong> (CHF in Switzerland, EUR in France) to get the best rate.</p>

      <h2>Exchange Rate Tips</h2>
      <p>Monitor the CHF/EUR exchange rate using apps like <strong>XE</strong> or <strong>Wise</strong>. Rather than making many small conversions, try to convert larger amounts when the rate is favourable. You can set <strong>rate alerts</strong> on most currency apps to be notified when the exchange rate reaches a level you are comfortable with.</p>
      <p>Historically, the rate has ranged between approximately <strong>0.92 and 1.10 EUR per CHF</strong>. Even small differences in the rate add up over time, especially for large recurring expenses like rent.</p>

      <h2>Budget Considerations</h2>
      <p>Living in France is generally <strong>30 to 40% cheaper</strong> than Geneva for housing and groceries. A common strategy among CERN employees is to receive your salary in CHF, convert what you need to EUR for French expenses, and keep the rest in CHF for Swiss spending or savings.</p>
      <p>Monthly costs vary widely depending on your situation. <strong>Rent</strong> is typically the biggest factor, followed by <strong>health insurance</strong> and <strong>food</strong>. Planning your conversions around your monthly expense cycle helps you avoid unnecessary fees and take advantage of better rates.</p>
