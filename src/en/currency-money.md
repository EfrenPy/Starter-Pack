<h1>Currency &amp; Money</h1>
<div class="alert">
<strong>💡 Tip</strong><br>
<p>CERN salary is paid in Swiss francs. If you live in France, setting up an efficient currency conversion method can save you hundreds of euros per year.</p>
</div>

<h2>The CHF/EUR Reality</h2>
<p>One of the first things you will notice after arriving at CERN is that your salary lands in <strong>Swiss francs (CHF)</strong>, but a large part of your life may run on <strong>euros (EUR)</strong>. If you settle in the Pays de Gex or anywhere on the French side, rent, groceries, and most day-to-day spending happen in euros. Stay on the Swiss side and nearly everything is in francs. The exchange rate between the two currencies moves constantly, and over the course of a year those fluctuations can quietly eat into your budget -- or work in your favour, if you pay attention.</p>

<h2>Multi-Currency Accounts</h2>
<p>The tool that most CERN newcomers set up within their first weeks is a multi-currency account. <strong>Wise</strong> (formerly TransferWise), <strong>Revolut</strong>, and <strong>N26</strong> all let you hold CHF and EUR side by side, convert at close-to-interbank rates, and pay in either currency with minimal fees. For cross-border life, these services are close to indispensable.</p>
<p>Traditional banks like <strong>UBS</strong> or <strong>Credit Agricole</strong> offer CHF/EUR accounts too, but their spreads and conversion fees tend to be noticeably worse. Most people end up using a digital bank as a day-to-day currency tool alongside a main Swiss or French account for salary deposits and direct debits.</p>

<h2>ATM &amp; Card Payments</h2>
<p>Card acceptance differs slightly on each side of the border. In Switzerland, <strong>Maestro and debit cards</strong> work almost everywhere -- shops, restaurants, supermarkets. In France, <strong>Visa and Mastercard debit</strong> cards are the norm. Credit cards will technically work for cash withdrawals, but the fees are steep enough that it is never worth doing.</p>
<p>You will also find that many French supermarkets near the border accept CHF, which sounds convenient until you realise they give change in EUR at a poor rate -- not a strategy for currency conversion. Watch out, too, for <strong>dynamic currency conversion</strong> at some border-area ATMs: it looks like a helpful option, but the markup is usually significant. The simple rule is to always pay or withdraw in the <strong>local currency</strong> -- CHF in Switzerland, EUR in France -- and let your own bank or multi-currency app handle the conversion.</p>

<h2>Exchange Rate Tips</h2>
<p>Apps like <strong>XE</strong> or <strong>Wise</strong> make it easy to track the CHF/EUR rate day to day. Rather than converting small amounts whenever you need cash, it pays to batch your conversions and move a larger sum when the rate looks good. Most currency apps let you set <strong>rate alerts</strong>, so you get a notification the moment the exchange rate hits a level you are happy with.</p>
<p>Over the past several years the rate has moved between roughly <strong>0.92 and 1.10 EUR per CHF</strong>. A few centimes' difference might seem trivial, but it compounds fast on recurring costs like rent -- over twelve months, timing your conversions well can make a real difference.</p>

<h2>Budget Considerations</h2>
<p>Housing and groceries on the French side are typically <strong>30 to 40% cheaper</strong> than in Geneva, which is a big part of why so many CERN employees choose to live across the border. The classic approach is straightforward: receive your salary in CHF, convert what you need to EUR for French expenses, and keep the rest in francs for Swiss spending or savings.</p>
<p>How much you spend each month depends heavily on your situation, but <strong>rent</strong> is almost always the largest line item, followed by <strong>health insurance</strong> and <strong>food</strong>. Aligning your currency conversions with your monthly expense cycle -- converting once or twice around the time bills are due -- helps you dodge unnecessary fees and gives you a better shot at catching a favourable rate.</p>
