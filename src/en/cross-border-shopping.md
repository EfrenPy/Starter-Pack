<h1>Cross-Border Shopping Near CERN</h1>

      <div class="alert">
        <strong>⚠️ Note</strong><br>
        <p>Prices, customs limits, and opening hours may change. Always check with official sources for the latest regulations.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Why Cross-Border Shopping?</h2>
      <p>There are significant <strong>price differences</strong> between Switzerland and France, with groceries and everyday items often 20-40% cheaper on the French side. Many CERN employees, whether living in Switzerland or France, regularly shop across the border to save money on groceries, wine, and household products. French supermarkets in Saint-Genis-Pouilly and Ferney-Voltaire are just minutes from CERN, making cross-border shopping easy and practical.</p>

      <h2>French Supermarkets</h2>
      <p><strong>Carrefour</strong> in Saint-Genis-Pouilly is a large hypermarket with a wide selection of food, household goods, and electronics at competitive prices. <strong>Leclerc</strong> has branches in Thoiry and Ferney-Voltaire and is known for competitive pricing; the Thoiry location includes a large shopping centre with additional stores. For budget shopping, <strong>Lidl</strong> has locations near Saint-Genis and Ferney, offering great deals on staples and weekly special offers on non-food items. <strong>Intermarche</strong> is available in several nearby towns with a good selection of French products, local cheeses, and wines at reasonable prices.</p>
      <p>French supermarkets typically open from <strong>8:30 to 19:30</strong> Monday to Saturday. Some open on Sunday mornings until 12:30, though hours may vary by location and season.</p>

      <h2>Swiss Supermarkets</h2>
      <p><strong>Migros</strong>, Switzerland's largest supermarket chain, offers good quality own-brand products but at higher prices than France. It is convenient for quick stops, though notably it does not sell alcohol. <strong>Coop</strong>, the second-largest chain, has a wider product range including alcohol, with slightly higher prices than Migros for most items. <strong>Lidl</strong> and <strong>Aldi</strong> in Switzerland offer lower prices than Migros and Coop, though still generally higher than their French equivalents.</p>
      <p>For a typical weekly shop, you may save <strong>CHF 50 to 100</strong> by shopping in France instead of Switzerland, depending on what you buy.</p>

      <h2>Customs &amp; Tax-Free</h2>
      <p>When importing goods from France to Switzerland for personal use, there is a <strong>CHF 300 value limit</strong> per person per day, below which no customs duties apply. At the border crossing, use the green channel if you have nothing to declare (under the limit) and the red channel if you exceed it or carry restricted items. Swiss residents can also claim a <strong>VAT refund (detaxe)</strong> on purchases made in France above a certain threshold -- ask for a detaxe form at the shop checkout and have it stamped at the French border customs.</p>
      <p>Specific limits apply to certain goods when entering Switzerland: <strong>1 kg of meat</strong>, 1 kg of butter, 5 litres of wine, and 1 litre of spirits per person per day. Amounts above these limits are subject to duties.</p>

      <h2>Sunday &amp; Holiday Hours</h2>
      <p>In <strong>Switzerland</strong>, most shops are closed on Sundays, except those at train stations (such as Geneva Cornavin) and some convenience stores in the city centre. Shops in Geneva may open on the first Sunday of the month. In <strong>France</strong>, some supermarkets open on Sunday mornings until around 12:30, and bakeries and small food shops often do as well.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that Switzerland and France have <strong>different public holidays</strong>, so a shop may be open on one side of the border while closed on the other. Check local calendars to plan your shopping ahead of time.</p>

      <h2>Farmers Markets</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Ferney-Voltaire</strong> Saturday morning market is one of the best in the area, offering fresh local produce, cheese, bread, flowers, and regional specialities. <strong>Gex</strong> holds a smaller Thursday morning market with excellent local products from the Jura region, including Comte cheese and cured meats. On the Swiss side, the <strong>Plainpalais market</strong> in Geneva is a large open-air market on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays with a wide variety of fresh produce, artisan goods, and international food stalls.</p>
      <p>Farmers markets offer seasonal, locally sourced fruits, vegetables, dairy, and meats at competitive prices. They are a great way to discover regional French and Swiss products that you will not find in supermarkets.</p>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <p>Always keep your <strong>shopping receipts</strong> when crossing the border, as customs officers may ask to see them and you will need them for any VAT refund claims. If your salary is in CHF, use a multi-currency card like <strong>Wise</strong> or <strong>Revolut</strong> for paying in euros at French shops to get the best exchange rate.</p>
      <p>Wine, cheese, bread, and fresh produce are significantly cheaper and often better quality in France, so many CERN employees do a <strong>large weekly shop</strong> on the French side. Prescription and over-the-counter medicines are also generally cheaper in French pharmacies than in Swiss ones -- the pharmacy in Saint-Genis-Pouilly is a popular option.</p>
