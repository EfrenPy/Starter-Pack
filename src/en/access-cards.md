# Access Cards at CERN

<div class="alert">
<p>Your CERN access card is your <strong>primary identification</strong> on site. It must be worn visibly at all times and is required for entering buildings, gates, and restricted areas.</p>
</div>

## CERN Access Card

The CERN access card is issued during your registration at the Users Office. It serves as your **ID badge** and grants physical access to the CERN sites. The card is RFID-enabled and works with door readers and gate barriers across the campus.

You must carry your access card at all times while on CERN premises. It is used not only for building access but also for identification purposes during security checks.

## Card Types

CERN issues several types of access cards depending on your relationship with the organization. The **staff card (blue)** is given to CERN staff members with employment contracts, while the **user card (pink/red)** is issued to registered users, fellows, and associates. Personnel from external companies working on CERN projects receive a **contractor card**, and short-term visitors are given a temporary **visitor card**, typically valid for a single day or event.

The validity period of your card depends on your contract type. Staff cards are typically valid for the duration of the contract, while user cards may need periodic renewal.

## Getting Your Card

Your access card is issued at the **Users Office (Building 55)** during your initial registration. You will need to bring a valid passport or national ID card, your contract letter or appointment confirmation from CERN, and a passport-style photo (which can be taken on site if needed).

The process is typically completed on the same day. You will also undergo **biometric registration** (fingerprint) which is linked to your card for access to certain restricted areas.

## Building & Zone Access

Not all buildings at CERN have the same access level. Your card grants you access to general areas by default, but specific buildings and zones may require additional authorization through the **ADaMS** system (Access and Safety at CERN). Your supervisor must approve any access requests for restricted zones.

Accelerator tunnels and experimental caverns require **specific safety training** before access is granted. Keep in mind that access rights are reviewed periodically and may be revoked if your training certifications expire.

## Vehicle Access

If you drive to CERN, you need a separate **vehicle sticker** in addition to your personal access card. You can apply for one through the ADaMS system. The gate barriers use your badge to verify authorization for both entry and exit.

Different parking zones exist across the campus, so check which zone your building belongs to. Bicycle access does not require a sticker, but you should still carry your badge at all times.

## ADaMS Mobile

**ADaMS** (Access and Safety at CERN) also has a mobile application that lets you manage your access rights and safety information on the go. Through the app, you can check your current authorizations, request access to new buildings or zones, and view your safety training status and upcoming renewals.

The app also provides quick access to emergency contacts and safety information. You can download it from the CERN internal app distribution system.

## Lost or Stolen Card

If your access card is lost or stolen, report it to the **Users Office** as soon as possible. The lost card will be deactivated immediately to prevent unauthorized access. A replacement card will be issued once you present your passport or ID for verification, and temporary access arrangements can be made while you wait for the new card.

## Leaving CERN

When your contract or association with CERN ends, you must return your access card to the **Users Office** on your last day. Your badge and all associated access rights will be deactivated at that point. You will also need to complete the final clearance process, which includes returning equipment and settling any outstanding administrative matters.
