<h1>Medical Services &amp; Emergencies at CERN</h1>

      <div class="alert">
        <strong>⚠️ Important</strong><br>
        <p>In a life-threatening emergency at CERN, dial 74444 (internal) or +41 22 767 4444 (external). Outside CERN, dial 144 (Switzerland) or 15 (France) for an ambulance, or 112 for the European emergency number.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>CERN Medical Service</h2>
      <p>The <strong>CERN Medical Service</strong> is located in Building 57 on the Meyrin site and serves as the primary healthcare facility for everyone working at CERN. It provides occupational health services, general medical consultations, vaccinations, and medical certificates. The service is open <strong>Monday to Friday, from 8:00 to 12:00 and 13:30 to 17:00</strong>, and remains closed on weekends and CERN closure days.</p>
      <p>Appointments can be booked by phone or through the CERN Medical Service website, and walk-ins may be accepted depending on availability. It is important to note that the Medical Service <strong>does not provide emergency care outside of opening hours</strong>. If you need urgent medical attention after hours, you should call the CERN Fire Brigade at 74444 or go directly to a hospital.</p>

      <h2>CERN Infirmary</h2>
      <p>The CERN Infirmary provides <strong>first aid and treatment for minor injuries</strong> and ailments on site during working hours. It can handle minor cuts, bruises, headaches, and similar non-urgent conditions, but it is not equipped for serious injuries or emergencies.</p>
      <p>If you experience a minor health issue during the workday, the infirmary should be your first stop. For anything more serious, contact the CERN Fire Brigade at <strong>74444</strong> or go to a hospital directly.</p>

      <h2>Emergency at CERN</h2>
      <p>In any emergency on site, dial <strong>74444</strong> from an internal CERN phone, or <strong>+41 22 767 4444</strong> from a mobile phone. This connects you to the <strong>CERN Fire Brigade</strong>, which coordinates all emergency responses on site. The Fire Brigade is trained to handle medical emergencies, fires, chemical spills, and other incidents, and they are available <strong>24 hours a day, 7 days a week</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Automated external defibrillators</strong> (AEDs) are available at various locations across the CERN site -- look for the green AED signs in buildings. If an emergency occurs, call 74444, state your location clearly including the building and room number, describe the situation, and do not hang up until told to do so. If possible, send someone to meet the emergency team at the building entrance.</p>

      <h2>Hospitals</h2>
      <p>The main hospital in the area is <strong>HUG</strong> (Hopitaux Universitaires de Geneve), which has a <strong>24/7 emergency department</strong>. It is located at Rue Gabrielle-Perret-Gentil 4, 1205 Geneva, and is accessible by tram 15 or bus. For those living on the French side, the <strong>Centre Hospitalier du Pays de Gex</strong> in Gex is closer to CERN and has an emergency department for less critical cases.</p>
      <p>Several <strong>medical centres and clinics</strong> in Meyrin and the surrounding areas also offer walk-in appointments and minor urgent care during business hours, which can be a convenient option for non-emergency situations.</p>

      <h2>Finding a Doctor</h2>
      <p>To find a <strong>general practitioner</strong> (medecin generaliste), you can register with a local doctor near your residence. In Switzerland, you do not always need a referral to see a specialist, though some insurance plans may require one. You can use online directories or ask your commune for a list of doctors accepting new patients, but be aware that <strong>waiting lists can be long</strong> in the Geneva area.</p>
      <p>If you live in France, it is recommended to register with a <strong>medecin traitant</strong> (primary care doctor) through the French healthcare system, as this ensures you receive full reimbursement rates. The CERN Medical Service can also recommend doctors and specialists in the area -- just ask at your next appointment or contact them by phone.</p>

      <h2>Pharmacies</h2>
      <p>Several pharmacies are located in <strong>Meyrin and Vernier</strong>, close to CERN on the Swiss side, where they dispense prescriptions from Swiss or CERN doctors during standard business hours. On the French side, pharmacies in <strong>Saint-Genis-Pouilly and Ferney-Voltaire</strong> accept French prescriptions and some Swiss prescriptions.</p>
      <p>If you need a pharmacy on a Sunday, holiday, or at night, a rotating <strong>pharmacie de garde</strong> schedule determines which one is open -- you can check the schedule online or on any pharmacy door. Prescriptions from the CERN Medical Service are generally accepted at both Swiss and French pharmacies. Always keep your <strong>CHIS card</strong> with you for reimbursement purposes.</p>

      <h2>Mental Health &amp; Wellbeing</h2>
      <p>Relocating to a new country to work at CERN is exciting, but it can also bring significant <strong>psychological challenges</strong>. Culture shock, language barriers, distance from family and friends, and the pressure of adapting to a new professional environment are all common experiences among expats in the Geneva area. These feelings are normal and usually ease over time, but it is important to recognise when you might need support and to know where to find it.</p>
      <p>CERN provides <strong>psychological support</strong> through its Medical Service, where you can request an appointment with a psychologist using the standard booking process. The <strong>Employee Assistance Programme (EAP)</strong> offers confidential short-term counselling, crisis support, and referral services for all CERN personnel and their family members. The EAP is independent from CERN management, and nothing discussed in sessions is ever shared with your supervisor or HR department. You can contact the EAP directly without going through the Medical Service.</p>
      <p>For ongoing therapy or specialised treatment, the Geneva area has a number of <strong>private psychologists and psychiatrists</strong> who work with international patients and offer consultations in English, French, and other languages. The CERN Medical Service can provide referrals, and online directories such as PsySearch.ch and Doctolib (for the French side) allow you to filter by language and specialisation. Be aware that waiting times for therapists in Geneva can be long, so it is advisable to start looking early if you feel the need. Costs for private mental health care may be partially covered by your CHIS insurance — check the reimbursement schedule before starting treatment.</p>
      <p>The Swiss and French mental health systems differ in their approach and accessibility. In <strong>Switzerland</strong>, a referral from a general practitioner is not always required to see a psychiatrist, but it may be needed for insurance reimbursement purposes. In <strong>France</strong>, the system is structured around the medecin traitant, and seeing a specialist without a referral may reduce your reimbursement rate. Both countries have well-established public mental health services, but access can be slower than private options.</p>
      <p>If you or someone you know is in a <strong>mental health crisis</strong>, the following resources are available around the clock. In Switzerland, call <strong>143</strong> (La Main Tendue / Die Dargebotene Hand), a 24/7 crisis helpline available in French, German, and Italian. In France, call <strong>3114</strong>, the national suicide prevention line. The CERN Fire Brigade at <strong>74444</strong> can also respond to any emergency on site, including mental health emergencies.</p>
