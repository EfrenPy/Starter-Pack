# Pre-Arrival Guide

<div class="alert">
<strong>💡 Tip</strong><br>
<p>Start your preparations as early as possible — some documents take weeks to obtain, and accommodation near CERN books up quickly.</p>
</div>

The period between signing your CERN contract and actually arriving in Geneva is crucial for a smooth transition. There is a significant amount of paperwork, planning, and packing to do, and handling it methodically before departure means you can focus on settling in once you arrive rather than scrambling to catch up on administrative tasks.

## Visa Requirements

Whether you need a visa to enter Switzerland depends on your **nationality**. Citizens of EU/EFTA countries can enter and work in Switzerland freely. Non-EU nationals will generally need a visa, and CERN's Host States Relations service will guide you through the process once your contract is confirmed. The typical route is a **D-type national visa** for Switzerland, which allows you to enter the country and collect your carte de legitimation upon arrival. Processing times vary by embassy, so apply promptly after receiving your contract documentation.

If you plan to live in France rather than Switzerland, you may also need a **French long-stay visa** or titre de sejour. CERN provides attestation letters to support your application, and the French consulate in your home country handles the visa process. Coordinate with both CERN HR and the relevant consulate to ensure your paperwork is aligned.

## Documents to Prepare

Gather all essential documents well before your departure date and make multiple copies — both physical and digital. The key documents include your **passport** (valid for at least six months beyond your arrival date), your CERN contract and appointment letter, university **diplomas and transcripts** (originals plus certified translations if not in English or French), birth certificates and marriage certificates (translated and apostilled if applicable), your driving license and international driving permit, medical records and vaccination history, and recent passport-sized photos.

Some of these documents will be needed for your CERN registration, others for opening a bank account or registering at your commune. Having them ready in advance avoids delays during your first weeks. Store digital scans in a cloud service so you can access them from anywhere if the originals are lost or delayed.

## What to Bring

Geneva has a **continental climate** with cold winters (temperatures regularly drop below zero from December to February) and warm summers. Bring appropriate clothing for all seasons, especially a good winter coat, waterproof shoes, and layers for the transitional months. If you take regular **prescription medication**, bring a supply to cover your first few months along with a letter from your doctor describing the medication and dosage — this makes it easier to obtain a local prescription.

Switzerland and France use **Type J and Type E/F electrical outlets** respectively. Bring adapters for your electronics, or plan to buy them upon arrival. A Swiss Type J adapter is not the same as a standard European plug, so check before you travel. Personal items that are difficult or expensive to replace locally — such as specific tools, specialised equipment, or sentimental items — should come with you in your luggage rather than being shipped separately.

## Booking Initial Accommodation

CERN operates a **hostel** (Building 39) that offers affordable short-term rooms for new arrivals, typically available for stays of a few days up to several weeks. Booking in advance through the CERN Housing Service is highly recommended, as the hostel fills up quickly during peak arrival periods (September and January in particular). Rates are modest compared to local hotels, and the hostel provides a convenient base while you search for longer-term housing.

If the CERN hostel is full, alternatives include **Airbnb apartments** in Meyrin, Saint-Genis-Pouilly, or Ferney-Voltaire, and budget hotels near the CERN Meyrin entrance. Avoid signing a long-term lease from abroad if possible — it is much better to see apartments in person before committing, as photos can be misleading and the market moves fast.

## Travel to Geneva

**Geneva Airport** (GVA) is the main gateway and is well-connected to major European cities. From the airport, CERN is approximately 20 minutes by car or 30 to 40 minutes by public transport (bus and tram). New arrivals can claim a **free TPG transport ticket** from the machines in the baggage reclaim area, valid for 80 minutes on all Geneva public transport. If you arrive by **train**, Geneva's main station (Geneve-Cornavin) has direct connections to CERN via tram 18 to the CERN terminus, a journey that takes about 25 minutes.

If you are driving to Geneva, be aware that the Swiss motorway network requires a **vignette** (annual motorway sticker), and border crossings between France and Switzerland may have queues during peak hours. Plan your route in advance and check current traffic conditions, especially if crossing France to reach the Geneva area.

## First Contacts

Before arriving, reach out to your **supervisor** and the **CERN Users Office** to confirm your arrival date and any specific requirements. Your supervisor can brief you on team practices, working hours, and what to expect on day one. The Users Office handles your registration and badge issuance and can answer questions about the onboarding process. If you have been assigned an **arrival coordinator** or a buddy from your group, connect with them by email — they can offer practical advice and help you prepare.

Join the **CERN Newcomers** group on social media or CERN's internal platforms if available, as current and recent arrivals often share tips on housing, transport, and settling in. The more you know before you arrive, the less overwhelming the first few days will feel.
