        <p data-i18n="doc_alert">CERN does not award PhD degrees. You must remain enrolled at your home university throughout your doctoral work. Make sure you understand your university's requirements before starting at CERN.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 data-i18n="doc_cern_doctoral_title">CERN &amp; Doctoral Students</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="doc_cern_doctoral_li1">CERN does not award PhD degrees. Your doctorate is granted by your home university, and you must remain registered there throughout your time at CERN.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_cern_doctoral_li2">CERN provides a world-class research environment, access to unique experimental facilities, and expert supervision for your doctoral research.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_cern_doctoral_li3">You will typically have both a CERN supervisor (for day-to-day research guidance) and a university supervisor (for academic and thesis requirements).</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_cern_doctoral_li4">The typical duration for doctoral work at CERN is 3 to 4 years, depending on your university's programme and your research progress.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="doc_programme_title">Doctoral Student Programme</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="doc_programme_li1">The CERN Doctoral Student programme is the main channel for PhD students to work at CERN. It is open to students enrolled in a doctoral programme at a university in a CERN Member or Associate Member State.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_programme_li2"><strong>Eligibility:</strong> You must be enrolled in a PhD programme, have a university supervisor, and your research topic must align with CERN's scientific activities. There are typically two application rounds per year.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_programme_li3"><strong>Contract:</strong> Doctoral students receive a limited-duration contract (usually up to 3 years). The contract includes a monthly stipend, travel allowance, and health insurance (CHIS).</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_programme_li4"><strong>Stipend:</strong> The monthly stipend covers living expenses in the Geneva area. The exact amount is reviewed periodically. A travel allowance for one return trip per year to your home institution is also provided.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="doc_thesis_title">Thesis at CERN</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="doc_thesis_li1">Your thesis is submitted to and evaluated by your home university, following their academic procedures and requirements. CERN does not grant the degree.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_thesis_li2"><strong>CERN supervisor role:</strong> Your CERN supervisor provides day-to-day research guidance, helps you navigate the CERN environment, and typically serves on your thesis committee or as an external reviewer.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_thesis_li3"><strong>Thesis committee:</strong> You may have a thesis committee with members from both CERN and your university. Regular progress reviews are common practice.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_thesis_li4"><strong>CERN-THESIS registration:</strong> All theses based on work done at CERN must be registered in the CERN Document Server (CDS) under the CERN-THESIS collection. This ensures your work is archived and accessible. CERN requires open access publication of your thesis.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="doc_hyperauthor_title">Hyper-Authorship</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="doc_hyperauthor_li1">Large experimental collaborations at CERN (such as ATLAS, CMS, ALICE, and LHCb) publish papers with author lists of 3,000 or more physicists. This is known as hyper-authorship.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_hyperauthor_li2">If you are a member of one of these collaborations, you will appear as an author on all papers published by the collaboration during your membership period, regardless of your direct involvement in each analysis.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_hyperauthor_li3"><strong>Implications for your CV:</strong> Hyper-authored papers demonstrate collaboration membership but may not clearly show your individual contribution. Highlight your specific analysis contributions separately on your CV.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_hyperauthor_li4"><strong>Single-author thesis papers:</strong> Your thesis itself and any single-author or small-group papers you publish are important for demonstrating your individual research capability. Discuss publication strategy with your supervisors early.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="doc_practical_title">Practical Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="doc_practical_li1"><strong>Contract duration:</strong> Doctoral student contracts are typically for up to 3 years. Extensions may be possible in exceptional cases but are not guaranteed.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_practical_li2"><strong>Social security:</strong> As a CERN doctoral student, you are covered by the CERN social security scheme. This includes pension contributions and insurance coverage during your contract.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_practical_li3"><strong>Health insurance:</strong> You are enrolled in CHIS (CERN Health Insurance Scheme). See the health insurance page on this site for details about coverage and the droit d'option if you live in France.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_practical_li4"><strong>Accommodation:</strong> CERN hostel rooms may be available for your initial weeks. After that, you will need to find private housing. The CERN Housing Service can help with your search.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_practical_li5"><strong>Travel budget:</strong> A travel allowance is provided for attending conferences, workshops, and visits to your home university. Discuss your travel plan with your supervisor and the relevant CERN department.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="doc_computing_title">Computing &amp; Resources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="doc_computing_li1"><strong>CERN computing account:</strong> You will receive a CERN computing account upon arrival. This gives you access to email, the CERN network, and all central computing services.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_computing_li2"><strong>lxplus:</strong> The lxplus interactive login service provides access to a shared Linux computing cluster for analysis work. Connect via SSH using your CERN credentials.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_computing_li3"><strong>EOS storage:</strong> EOS is CERN's large-scale storage system. You will have personal and project storage space for your data and analysis files.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_computing_li4"><strong>CERN GitLab:</strong> Use CERN's GitLab instance for version control and code collaboration. Most experiments and groups maintain their software repositories there.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_computing_li5"><strong>Indico &amp; Mattermost:</strong> Indico is used for scheduling meetings, conferences, and events. Mattermost is CERN's internal messaging platform for team communication.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="doc_after_title">After Your PhD</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="doc_after_li1"><strong>CERN fellowships:</strong> After completing your PhD, you can apply for CERN Research or Applied fellowships. These are competitive positions lasting 1-3 years.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_after_li2"><strong>Postdoc options:</strong> Many former CERN doctoral students continue in postdoctoral positions at CERN, at other laboratories, or at universities worldwide.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_after_li3"><strong>Leaving CERN:</strong> When your contract ends, you must complete the CERN departure procedure, which includes returning equipment, settling accounts, and obtaining clearance from various services.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_after_li4"><strong>Alumni network:</strong> CERN has an active alumni network. Stay connected for career opportunities, events, and to maintain your professional network in high-energy physics and beyond.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="doc_tips_title">Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="doc_tips_li1"><strong>Maintain close contact with your home university:</strong> Regular communication with your university supervisor and department is essential. Do not let the physical distance create an academic gap.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_tips_li2"><strong>Attend CERN Academic Training:</strong> CERN offers an extensive academic training programme with lectures and courses. These are excellent for broadening your knowledge and meeting researchers from other fields.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_tips_li3"><strong>Network at workshops and conferences:</strong> Take advantage of CERN's central position in the physics community. Attend workshops, present your work, and build your professional network early.</li>
        <li data-i18n="doc_tips_li4"><strong>Plan your thesis writing timeline early:</strong> Do not leave thesis writing to the last months. Start structuring your thesis and writing chapters well in advance of your expected submission date.</li>
      </ul>
