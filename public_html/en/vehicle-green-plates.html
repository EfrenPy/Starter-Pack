        <strong>&#9888;&#65039; Important</strong><br>
        <p data-i18n="vgp_alert">Green plates are a privilege tied to your CERN status. Misuse or failure to return them when leaving can result in fines and customs issues. Follow all procedures carefully.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_overview_title">Green Plates Overview</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_overview_li1">CERN international staff with a carte de legitimation are eligible for CD (Corps Diplomatique) green plates, which allow tax-free vehicle registration in Switzerland.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_overview_li2">Green plates are issued by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) through CERN's Host States Relations service.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_overview_li3">The duration of your green plates is linked to your CERN contract. When your contract ends, you must return or convert your plates.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_overview_li4">Vehicles with green plates are exempt from Swiss customs duty and TVA (VAT) on purchase. This can represent significant savings.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_overview_li5">Only international staff members (not fellows or associates without a carte de legitimation) are typically eligible for green plates.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_bring_title">Bringing Your Car</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_bring_li1"><strong>Temporary importation:</strong> You can bring your existing car into Switzerland temporarily (up to 1 year) without paying customs duties, provided you have owned the vehicle for at least 6 months before arriving.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_bring_li2"><strong>Definitive importation:</strong> If you want to keep your car permanently, you must go through the customs clearance process. Present your purchase invoice, original registration, and proof of insurance at Geneva customs.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_bring_li3"><strong>Required documents:</strong> Original vehicle registration certificate, purchase invoice or proof of ownership, valid insurance certificate (green card), passport, and CERN carte de legitimation.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_bring_li4"><strong>Timing:</strong> Start the importation process as soon as possible after arriving. Delays can complicate the customs procedure. Contact CERN's Host States Relations service for guidance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_buy_ch_title">Buying a Car in Switzerland</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_buy_ch_li1"><strong>Tax-free purchase:</strong> With green plates, you can buy a new car in Switzerland without paying TVA (currently 7.7%). This can save thousands of francs on a new vehicle.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_buy_ch_li2"><strong>Process:</strong> Choose your vehicle at a Swiss dealership, inform them you will register with green plates. The dealership will prepare the invoice without TVA. CERN's Host States Relations service handles the registration paperwork.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_buy_ch_li3"><strong>Registration steps:</strong> Submit the purchase invoice and insurance certificate to CERN's Host States Relations. They will process the green plate registration with the Swiss authorities. You will receive your plates and vehicle registration document.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_buy_ch_li4"><strong>Dealerships:</strong> Most major Swiss dealerships are familiar with the green plate process for international organisations. Some near CERN (Geneva area) have dedicated staff for this.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_buy_fr_title">Buying a Car in France</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_buy_fr_li1"><strong>No tax exemption:</strong> Unlike Switzerland, buying a car in France does not benefit from any tax exemption linked to your CERN status. You will pay full French TVA (20%).</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_buy_fr_li2"><strong>Second-hand market:</strong> France has a large second-hand car market. Websites like leboncoin.fr and La Centrale are popular for finding used vehicles.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_buy_fr_li3"><strong>Carte grise:</strong> To register a car in France, you need a carte grise (vehicle registration certificate). Apply online at the ANTS (Agence Nationale des Titres Securises) website or through an approved garage.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_buy_fr_li4"><strong>Controle technique:</strong> Cars over 4 years old must pass a controle technique (MOT equivalent) every 2 years. Ensure any used car you buy has a valid controle technique certificate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_license_title">Driving License</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_license_li1"><strong>International driving permit:</strong> An international driving permit (IDP) together with your national license is valid in Switzerland for up to 12 months from your arrival date.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_license_li2"><strong>Exchanging to Swiss license:</strong> After 12 months, you must exchange your license for a Swiss one. Switzerland has agreements with many countries allowing a direct exchange without a driving test.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_license_li3"><strong>CERN assistance:</strong> CERN's Host States Relations service can help you with the license exchange process, including providing the necessary attestations.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_license_li4"><strong>No driving test:</strong> If your country has a bilateral agreement with Switzerland (most EU/EFTA countries, USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, and others), you can exchange your license without taking a Swiss driving test.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_license_li5"><strong>France residents:</strong> If you live in France and hold a non-EU license, you may also need to exchange it for a French license. EU licenses are valid throughout France without exchange.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_insurance_title">Insurance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_insurance_li1"><strong>Mandatory:</strong> Third-party liability insurance (responsabilite civile) is mandatory in both Switzerland and France. You cannot register a vehicle without proof of insurance.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_insurance_li2"><strong>CERN group rates:</strong> CERN has negotiated group insurance rates with several providers. Check with the Staff Association or Host States Relations for current offers — they can be significantly cheaper than individual quotes.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_insurance_li3"><strong>Swiss vs French insurance:</strong> If your car has green plates (Swiss registration), you need Swiss insurance. If registered in France with a carte grise, you need French insurance.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_insurance_li4"><strong>TCS membership:</strong> Consider joining the Touring Club Suisse (TCS) for roadside assistance, legal protection, and travel insurance. CERN staff often get discounted membership rates.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_parking_title">Parking at CERN</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_parking_li1"><strong>Parking sticker:</strong> Apply for a CERN parking sticker through ADaMS (CERN's administrative database). You will need your vehicle registration details.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_parking_li2"><strong>Meyrin site:</strong> Parking at the Meyrin site is limited and spaces fill up early in the morning. Consider arriving before 8:30 or using alternative transport.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_parking_li3"><strong>Prevessin site:</strong> The Prevessin site generally has more parking availability than Meyrin. Free shuttle buses connect the two sites.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_parking_li4"><strong>Electric charging:</strong> CERN has installed electric vehicle charging stations at both Meyrin and Prevessin sites. Check the CERN maps for locations and availability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_selling_title">Selling Your Car / Leaving CERN</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_selling_li1"><strong>Returning green plates:</strong> When your CERN contract ends, you must return your green plates to CERN's Host States Relations service. This is mandatory and failure to do so can result in penalties.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_selling_li2"><strong>Re-export:</strong> If you are leaving Switzerland, you can re-export your vehicle to your home country or another destination without paying Swiss import duties.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_selling_li3"><strong>Selling in Switzerland:</strong> If you want to sell your green-plated car in Switzerland, the buyer must pay the customs duty and TVA that were originally exempted. Factor this into the sale price.</li>
        <li data-i18n="vgp_selling_li4"><strong>Timeline:</strong> Start the process at least 2-3 months before your departure date. Notify Host States Relations, arrange insurance cancellation, and complete the plate return procedure.</li>
      </ul>
