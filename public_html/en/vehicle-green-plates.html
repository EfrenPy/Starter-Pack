        <strong>&#9888;&#65039; Important</strong><br>
        <p data-i18n="vgp_alert">Green plates are a privilege tied to your CERN status. Misuse or failure to return them when leaving can result in fines and customs issues. Follow all procedures carefully.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_overview_title">Green Plates Overview</h2>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_overview_p1">CERN international staff who hold a <strong>carte de legitimation</strong> are eligible for <strong>CD (Corps Diplomatique) green plates</strong>, which allow tax-free vehicle registration in Switzerland. These plates are issued by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) through CERN's Host States Relations service, and their duration is tied to your CERN contract — when your contract ends, you must return or convert them.</p>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_overview_p2">Vehicles registered with green plates are <strong>exempt from Swiss customs duty and TVA (VAT)</strong> on purchase, which can represent significant savings. Keep in mind that only international staff members are typically eligible; fellows and associates without a carte de legitimation generally do not qualify.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_bring_title">Bringing Your Car</h2>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_bring_p1">If you already own a vehicle, you can bring it into Switzerland under a <strong>temporary importation</strong> for up to one year without paying customs duties, provided you have owned it for at least six months before arriving. For a <strong>permanent stay</strong>, you will need to go through the customs clearance process at Geneva customs, presenting your purchase invoice, original registration, and proof of insurance.</p>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_bring_p2">The key documents you will need include your original vehicle registration certificate, purchase invoice or proof of ownership, a valid insurance certificate (green card), your passport, and your CERN carte de legitimation. Start the importation process as soon as possible after arriving, since delays can complicate the procedure. CERN's <strong>Host States Relations</strong> service can guide you through the steps.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_buy_ch_title">Buying a Car in Switzerland</h2>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_buy_ch_p1">With green plates you can purchase a new car in Switzerland <strong>without paying TVA</strong> (currently 7.7%), which can save thousands of francs. Simply choose your vehicle at a Swiss dealership and let them know you will register with green plates — the dealer will prepare the invoice without TVA, and CERN's Host States Relations service handles the registration paperwork.</p>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_buy_ch_p2">To complete the registration, submit your purchase invoice and insurance certificate to Host States Relations. They will process the green plate registration with the Swiss authorities, and you will receive your plates and vehicle registration document. Most major Swiss dealerships are familiar with this process, and some near CERN in the Geneva area even have <strong>dedicated staff</strong> for international organisation registrations.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_buy_fr_title">Buying a Car in France</h2>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_buy_fr_p1">Unlike Switzerland, buying a car in France does <strong>not come with any tax exemption</strong> linked to your CERN status — you will pay the full French TVA of 20%. That said, France has a large <strong>second-hand market</strong>, with websites like leboncoin.fr and La Centrale being popular choices for finding used vehicles.</p>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_buy_fr_p2">To register a car in France you need a <strong>carte grise</strong> (vehicle registration certificate), which you can apply for online through the ANTS website or at an approved garage. Be aware that cars over four years old must pass a <strong>controle technique</strong> (the French equivalent of an MOT) every two years, so make sure any used car you buy has a valid certificate.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_license_title">Driving License</h2>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_license_p1">An <strong>international driving permit</strong> (IDP) paired with your national license is valid in Switzerland for up to 12 months from your arrival date. After that period you must exchange it for a Swiss license. Switzerland has agreements with many countries — including most EU/EFTA nations, the USA, Canada, Japan, and Australia — that allow a <strong>direct exchange without a driving test</strong>. CERN's Host States Relations service can help with the process and provide the necessary attestations.</p>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_license_p2">If you live in France and hold a <strong>non-EU license</strong>, you may also need to exchange it for a French one. EU licenses, however, are valid throughout France without any exchange required.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_insurance_title">Insurance</h2>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_insurance_p1"><strong>Third-party liability insurance</strong> (<em>responsabilite civile</em>) is mandatory in both Switzerland and France — you simply cannot register a vehicle without proof of coverage. CERN has negotiated <strong>group insurance rates</strong> with several providers, so check with the Staff Association or Host States Relations for current offers, as they can be significantly cheaper than individual quotes.</p>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_insurance_p2">The type of insurance you need depends on your registration: <strong>Swiss insurance</strong> for green-plated vehicles and <strong>French insurance</strong> for cars with a carte grise. You may also want to consider joining the <strong>Touring Club Suisse (TCS)</strong> for roadside assistance, legal protection, and travel insurance — CERN staff often benefit from discounted membership rates.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_parking_title">Parking at CERN</h2>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_parking_p1">To park on site, apply for a <strong>CERN parking sticker</strong> through ADaMS (CERN's administrative database) using your vehicle registration details. Parking at the <strong>Meyrin site</strong> is limited and fills up early in the morning, so consider arriving before 8:30 or using alternative transport. The <strong>Prevessin site</strong> generally has more availability, and free shuttle buses connect the two sites.</p>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_parking_p2">CERN has also installed <strong>electric vehicle charging stations</strong> at both the Meyrin and Prevessin sites. Check the CERN maps for locations and current availability.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="vgp_selling_title">Selling Your Car / Leaving CERN</h2>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_selling_p1">When your CERN contract ends, you <strong>must return your green plates</strong> to CERN's Host States Relations service — this is mandatory and failure to comply can result in penalties. If you are leaving Switzerland, you can <strong>re-export</strong> your vehicle to your home country or another destination without paying Swiss import duties.</p>
      <p data-i18n="vgp_selling_p2">If you prefer to sell your green-plated car in Switzerland, keep in mind that the buyer will need to pay the <strong>customs duty and TVA</strong> that were originally exempted, so factor this into the sale price. It is best to start the entire process at least <strong>two to three months</strong> before your departure date to allow time for notifying Host States Relations, cancelling your insurance, and completing the plate return procedure.</p>
