      <h2 data-i18n="cbs_why_title">Why Cross-Border Shopping?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_why_li1"><strong>Price differences:</strong> There are significant price differences between Switzerland and France. Groceries and everyday items can be 20-40% cheaper in France compared to Swiss supermarkets.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_why_li2"><strong>Common practice:</strong> Many CERN employees, whether living in Switzerland or France, regularly shop across the border to save money on groceries, wine, and household products.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_why_li3"><strong>Proximity:</strong> French supermarkets in Saint-Genis-Pouilly and Ferney-Voltaire are just minutes from CERN, making cross-border shopping easy and practical.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="cbs_french_title">French Supermarkets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_french_li1"><strong>Carrefour:</strong> Located in Saint-Genis-Pouilly. Large hypermarket with a wide selection of food, household goods, and electronics. Competitive prices.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_french_li2"><strong>Leclerc:</strong> Branches in Thoiry and Ferney-Voltaire. Known for competitive pricing. The Thoiry location has a large shopping centre with additional stores.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_french_li3"><strong>Lidl:</strong> Budget supermarket with locations near Saint-Genis and Ferney. Great for staples and weekly special offers on non-food items.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_french_li4"><strong>Intermarche:</strong> Available in several nearby towns. Good selection of French products, local cheeses, and wines at reasonable prices.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_french_li5"><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Typically 8:30 to 19:30 (Monday to Saturday). Some supermarkets open on Sunday mornings until 12:30. Hours may vary by location and season.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="cbs_swiss_title">Swiss Supermarkets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_swiss_li1"><strong>Migros:</strong> Switzerland's largest supermarket chain. Good quality own-brand products. Higher prices than France but convenient for quick stops. Does not sell alcohol.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_swiss_li2"><strong>Coop:</strong> Second-largest Swiss chain. Wider product range including alcohol. Slightly higher prices than Migros for most items.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_swiss_li3"><strong>Lidl and Aldi:</strong> Swiss branches of these discount chains offer lower prices than Migros/Coop, though still generally higher than French equivalents.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_swiss_li4"><strong>Comparison:</strong> For a typical weekly shop, you may save CHF 50-100 by shopping in France instead of Switzerland, depending on what you buy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="cbs_customs_title">Customs &amp; Tax-Free</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_customs_li1"><strong>Value limit:</strong> When importing goods from France to Switzerland for personal use, there is a CHF 300 value limit per person per day. Below this amount, no customs duties apply.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_customs_li2"><strong>Green/red channels:</strong> At the border crossing, use the green channel if you have nothing to declare (under the limit). Use the red channel if you exceed the limit or carry restricted items.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_customs_li3"><strong>VAT refund (detaxe):</strong> Swiss residents can claim a VAT refund on purchases made in France above a certain threshold. Ask for a detaxe form at the shop checkout and have it stamped at the French border customs.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_customs_li4"><strong>Common limits:</strong> Specific limits apply to certain goods: 1 kg of meat, 1 kg of butter, 5 litres of wine, and 1 litre of spirits per person per day when entering Switzerland. Amounts above these limits are subject to duties.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="cbs_hours_title">Sunday &amp; Holiday Hours</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_hours_li1"><strong>Switzerland:</strong> Most shops are closed on Sundays, except those at train stations (Geneva Cornavin) and some convenience stores in the city centre. Shops in Geneva may open on the first Sunday of the month.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_hours_li2"><strong>France:</strong> Some supermarkets open on Sunday mornings until around 12:30. Bakeries and small food shops often open Sunday mornings as well.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_hours_li3"><strong>Public holidays:</strong> Switzerland and France have different public holidays. A shop may be open on one side of the border while closed on the other. Check local calendars to plan ahead.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="cbs_markets_title">Farmers Markets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_markets_li1"><strong>Ferney-Voltaire:</strong> Saturday morning market in the town centre. Fresh local produce, cheese, bread, flowers, and regional specialities. One of the best markets in the area.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_markets_li2"><strong>Gex:</strong> Thursday morning market. Smaller but with excellent local products from the Jura region, including Comte cheese and cured meats.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_markets_li3"><strong>Geneva (Plainpalais):</strong> Large open-air market on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. Wide variety of fresh produce, artisan goods, and international food stalls.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_markets_li4"><strong>Fresh produce:</strong> Markets offer seasonal, locally sourced fruits, vegetables, dairy, and meats at competitive prices. A great way to discover regional French and Swiss products.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="cbs_tips_title">Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_tips_li1"><strong>Keep receipts:</strong> Always keep your shopping receipts when crossing the border. Customs officers may ask to see them, and you will need them for any VAT refund claims.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_tips_li2"><strong>Use Wise/Revolut for EUR:</strong> If your salary is in CHF, use a multi-currency card (Wise, Revolut) for paying in euros at French shops to get the best exchange rate.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_tips_li3"><strong>Stock up on French goods:</strong> Wine, cheese, bread, and fresh produce are significantly cheaper and often better quality in France. Many CERN employees do a large weekly shop in France.</li>
        <li data-i18n="cbs_tips_li4"><strong>Pharmacies:</strong> Prescription and over-the-counter medicines are generally cheaper in French pharmacies than in Swiss ones. The pharmacy in Saint-Genis-Pouilly is a popular option.</li>
      </ul>
