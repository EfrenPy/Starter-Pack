        <strong>&#9888;&#65039; Disclaimer</strong><br>
        <p data-i18n="ccr_disclaimer">This page is for general informational purposes only. Always consult CERN HR or the Staff Association for up-to-date information on your contractual situation.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 data-i18n="ccr_types_title">Contract Types</h2>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_types_p1">CERN offers several contract types, each with different conditions and durations. <strong>Staff</strong> contracts -- either indefinite or limited duration -- are the most stable, with full access to all benefits. <strong>Fellows</strong> hold limited-duration contracts of up to 3 years, aimed at post-doctoral or early-career professionals. <strong>Doctoral students</strong> participate in a programme of up to 3 years while remaining enrolled at a home university.</p>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_types_p2">In addition, <strong>associates</strong> are personnel sent by member state institutes to work on specific CERN projects, and <strong>users</strong> are affiliated researchers who use CERN facilities but are not direct employees. Each category carries different rights, benefits, and administrative obligations.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="ccr_staff_title">Staff Contracts</h2>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_staff_p1">Staff contracts typically start as <strong>limited duration (LD)</strong>, which can be extended up to a maximum of 8 years in total. During this period, you may apply for conversion to an <strong>indefinite duration</strong> contract, though this depends on your performance and CERN's operational needs.</p>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_staff_p2">CERN staff are classified into <strong>grades</strong> (reflecting level of responsibility) and <strong>steps</strong> (reflecting experience), with step advancement occurring annually. Several career paths exist -- technical, administrative, and research -- each with its own progression criteria.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="ccr_fellowship_title">Fellowship Programme</h2>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_fellowship_p1">The CERN Fellowship Programme targets <strong>post-doctoral or early-career professionals</strong> in physics, engineering, computing, or other relevant disciplines. Contracts last a maximum of <strong>3 years</strong> and cannot be extended beyond this limit. The selection process is highly competitive, with periodic calls and evaluation committees.</p>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_fellowship_p2">It is important to know that the fellowship is a <strong>one-time opportunity</strong> -- you cannot re-apply for the same programme after completing it. Fellows receive a monthly stipend plus allowances for installation, travel, and, where applicable, family expenses.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="ccr_doctoral_title">Doctoral Students</h2>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_doctoral_p1">The <strong>CERN Doctoral Student programme</strong> allows doctoral research to be carried out at CERN facilities for a maximum of 3 years. Students must remain enrolled at their home university throughout the entire period. Doctoral students receive a monthly stipend and allowances, though the conditions differ from those of fellows.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="ccr_extension_title">Extension Rules</h2>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_extension_p1">Limited duration staff contracts are reviewed at the <strong>5-year mark</strong>, at which point extension or conversion to an indefinite contract depends on performance and CERN's needs. Fellowship contracts, by contrast, <strong>cannot be extended beyond 3 years</strong> in total -- there are no exceptions to this rule.</p>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_extension_p2">Rules also exist on the <strong>maximum cumulative duration</strong> of employment at CERN under different contract types. Additionally, mandatory gaps may be required between certain consecutive contract types, which is worth keeping in mind when planning your career trajectory.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="ccr_career_title">Career Development</h2>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_career_p1">All staff participate in the annual <strong>MARS</strong> (Merit Appraisal and Recognition of Staff) review system, which evaluates performance and sets objectives for the coming year. CERN also offers extensive training opportunities through the <strong>Learning Hub</strong>, covering technical skills, languages, and professional development.</p>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_career_p2"><strong>Internal mobility</strong> between departments and projects is actively encouraged to broaden experience and skills. Promotion criteria include performance, competencies, experience, and availability of positions at higher grades. CERN also provides <strong>career counselling</strong> services to help staff plan their professional path.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="ccr_leaving_title">Leaving CERN</h2>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_leaving_p1">When your time at CERN comes to an end, <strong>notice periods</strong> vary by contract type and seniority -- check your contract or consult HR for exact timelines. End-of-contract procedures include returning equipment, closing accounts, completing pension formalities, and updating your permits. Depending on your contract type and length of service, you may be entitled to <strong>end-of-contract indemnities</strong>.</p>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_leaving_p2">Your <strong>pension options</strong> depend on your years of service (see the Pension Fund page for details). Expatriate staff may also be entitled to a <strong>repatriation grant</strong> at the end of their contract. Finally, CERN issues a <strong>certificate of employment</strong> detailing your position and period of service, which is useful for future job applications.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="ccr_tips_title">Practical Tips</h2>
      <p data-i18n="ccr_tips_p1">Make sure you understand your <strong>contract type and its duration limits</strong> from day one. If you are a fellow or doctoral student, plan ahead for the end of your contract well in advance. Take advantage of CERN's <strong>career counselling services</strong> to map out your professional path, and keep careful track of your MARS reviews and professional achievements throughout your career.</p>
