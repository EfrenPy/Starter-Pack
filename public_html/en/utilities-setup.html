        <strong>&#9888;&#65039; Important</strong><br>
        <p data-i18n="uts_alert">Utility systems differ significantly between Switzerland and France. Start setting up accounts before your move-in date to avoid delays.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 data-i18n="uts_overview_title">Overview</h2>
      <p data-i18n="uts_overview_p1">Switzerland and France have different utility providers, billing systems, and regulations, so your setup process depends entirely on which side of the border you live. In Switzerland, many utilities are bundled with the rental contract or handled automatically by the landlord, while in France tenants typically need to <strong>open their own accounts</strong>.</p>
      <p data-i18n="uts_overview_p2">Plan to set up utilities <strong>1 to 2 weeks before your move-in date</strong> to ensure everything is active when you arrive. Internet installation may take longer, especially in France.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="uts_electricity_title">Electricity & Gas</h2>
      <p data-i18n="uts_electricity_p1">In <strong>Switzerland (Geneva)</strong>, SIG (Services Industriels de Geneve) is the sole provider for electricity, gas, and water in the canton. Your account is typically activated automatically when you sign your rental contract, though you may need to contact SIG to confirm the transfer. In <strong>France</strong>, EDF is the main electricity provider and Engie (formerly GDF Suez) handles gas. You need to open an account by calling or registering online, and setup takes approximately 2 weeks. Have your new address and move-in date ready.</p>
      <p data-i18n="uts_electricity_p2">For a flat in France, expect approximately <strong>EUR 80 to 150 per month</strong> for electricity and gas combined, depending on apartment size and heating type. On the day you move in, always take note of your <strong>electricity and gas meter readings</strong> to protect yourself from being charged for the previous tenant's consumption.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="uts_water_title">Water</h2>
      <p data-i18n="uts_water_p1">In <strong>Switzerland</strong>, water is provided by SIG and is usually included in the rental charges (charges communes), so you typically do not need a separate subscription. In <strong>France</strong>, water supply varies by commune -- in some areas it is included in the communal charges, while in others you may need a separate subscription with the local provider (such as Suez, Veolia, or the communal water service). The good news is that <strong>tap water is safe to drink</strong> on both sides of the border, and both Geneva and the Pays de Gex area have excellent water quality.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="uts_internet_title">Internet & Mobile</h2>
      <p data-i18n="uts_internet_p1">In <strong>Switzerland</strong>, the main internet providers are Swisscom, Sunrise, and Salt. Fibre optic is widely available in the Geneva area, with monthly costs of CHF 50-80 for broadband. In <strong>France</strong>, the main providers are Orange, Free, SFR, and Bouygues Telecom. <strong>Free's Freebox</strong> is particularly popular among CERN employees for its competitive pricing (EUR 20-40/month) and included TV service.</p>
      <p data-i18n="uts_internet_p2">If you live in France and work at CERN, consider a French mobile plan with <strong>EU roaming</strong> that covers Switzerland for calls, as some providers offer specific cross-border packages. At work, CERN provides <strong>eduroam Wi-Fi</strong> on all sites using your CERN credentials, and you can also use eduroam at universities and research institutions worldwide. Most modern phones support <strong>eSIM</strong>, which is convenient for maintaining both a Swiss and French number without carrying two physical SIM cards.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="uts_tv_title">TV License</h2>
      <p data-i18n="uts_tv_p1">In <strong>Switzerland</strong>, the Serafe fee is CHF 335 per year and is mandatory for all households, regardless of whether you own a TV or radio. It is billed separately and cannot be avoided. In <strong>France</strong>, the contribution a l'audiovisuel public has been phased out as of 2022, so you no longer need to pay a TV license fee.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="uts_waste_title">Waste & Recycling</h2>
      <p data-i18n="uts_waste_p1">Geneva uses <strong>taxed garbage bags</strong> (sacs taxe) costing approximately CHF 2 per 35-litre bag, and you must use official bags purchased from supermarkets. Recycling is strongly encouraged and free -- separate paper, glass, PET, aluminium, and organic waste. Each Swiss commune also has a recycling centre (<strong>dechetterie</strong>) where you can drop off bulky items, electronics, and hazardous waste for free.</p>
      <p data-i18n="uts_waste_p2">In <strong>France</strong>, waste collection is included in local taxes (taxe d'habitation/taxe fonciere). Sorting rules are less strict than in Switzerland, but recycling is increasingly required. Yellow bins are for recyclables and green bins for glass.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="uts_tips_title">Tips</h2>
      <p data-i18n="uts_tips_p1">Contact utility providers <strong>1 to 2 weeks before moving in</strong> to ensure everything is active on your arrival date, and store copies of all utility contracts and correspondence -- you will need them for administrative procedures and when moving out.</p>
      <p data-i18n="uts_tips_p2">In France, consider <strong>bundling internet, mobile, and TV</strong> with the same provider (such as Free) for savings, while in Switzerland Swisscom and Sunrise offer similar bundles. Always note electricity, gas, and water <strong>meter readings</strong> when you move in and when you move out, and take photos as evidence.</p>
