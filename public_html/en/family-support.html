        <strong>&#9888;&#65039; Important</strong><br>
        <p data-i18n="fms_alert">Relocating with your family requires early planning. Many CERN support programmes have application windows and eligibility conditions — start the process as soon as you receive your contract.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 data-i18n="fms_relocation_title">Relocating with Family</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="fms_relocation_li1">CERN provides relocation support for employees arriving with their families. Contact the CERN Housing Service and HR department early to understand available assistance.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_relocation_li2">A settling-in allowance may be available depending on your contract type. This one-time payment helps cover initial expenses such as deposits, temporary accommodation, and moving costs.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_relocation_li3">The CERN Housing Service can assist with your housing search, providing listings and advice for both the Swiss and French sides of the border.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_relocation_li4"><strong>Family checklist:</strong> Gather all necessary documents (passports, marriage certificates, birth certificates, translated and apostilled), arrange school enrolment, and plan health insurance coverage for all family members before arrival.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="fms_spouses_title">Spouses &amp; Partners Forum</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="fms_spouses_li1">The CERN Spouses &amp; Partners Forum is a CERN-supported network for the partners and spouses of CERN personnel. It helps newcomers integrate into life in the Geneva area.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_spouses_li2">The forum organises regular meetings, social events, language courses, and cultural activities throughout the year.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_spouses_li3">Career advice sessions and workshops are available to help partners explore employment and professional development opportunities in Switzerland and France.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_spouses_li4">To connect with the forum, visit the CERN Welcome Club website or contact the CERN Staff Association for meeting schedules and registration details.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="fms_dual_career_title">Dual Career Support</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="fms_dual_career_li1">CERN runs a Dual Career programme specifically designed to support the professional lives of partners who relocate to the Geneva area.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_dual_career_li2">The programme offers career workshops, CV review sessions, and interview preparation tailored to the local Swiss and French job markets.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_dual_career_li3">Networking events connect partners with local employers, international organisations, and other professionals in the region.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_dual_career_li4">Job search resources include access to local job boards, guidance on Swiss and French employment practices, and information about work permits for non-EU nationals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="fms_employment_title">Partner Employment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="fms_employment_li1">Work rights for partners depend on the country of residence and the type of permit held. The rules differ significantly between Switzerland and France.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_employment_li2"><strong>Swiss carte de legitimation:</strong> Partners holding a dependent carte de legitimation may face restrictions on taking up paid employment in Switzerland. Check with the Swiss Mission or HR for your specific situation.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_employment_li3"><strong>French titre de sejour:</strong> If you reside in France, partners may benefit from more flexible work authorisation rules. A titre de sejour obtained through the French authorities can allow employment in France.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_employment_li4"><strong>International organisations:</strong> Partners can also explore employment at other international organisations in Geneva (UN, WHO, ILO, WTO, etc.), which may have their own hiring processes for family members of international civil servants.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="fms_allowances_title">Family Allowances</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="fms_allowances_li1">CERN provides family allowances including a child allowance for each dependent child. The amount varies based on the child's age and educational status.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_allowances_li2">Education grants are available for children attending school or university, helping to cover tuition fees and related educational expenses.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_allowances_li3"><strong>How to apply:</strong> Submit your application through the CERN HR portal. You will need birth certificates, proof of dependency, and educational enrolment documents.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_allowances_li4">Apply promptly after joining CERN — allowances are generally not paid retroactively for extended periods. Keep HR updated if your family situation changes (new child, change in schooling, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="fms_childcare_title">Childcare &amp; Parenting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="fms_childcare_li1">CERN does not operate its own creche, but the CERN Staff Association and Welcome Club maintain up-to-date lists of childcare options near CERN on both the Swiss and French sides.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_childcare_li2">Parenting networks and baby/toddler groups operate through the CERN Welcome Club. These groups meet regularly and provide a support network for new parents in the area.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_childcare_li3">Family-friendly events are organised throughout the year, including holiday activities, outings, and workshops for children of various ages.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_childcare_li4">For detailed information on schools and childcare facilities, see the dedicated childcare and schools page on this site.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="fms_tips_title">Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="fms_tips_li1"><strong>Join the Spouses Forum early:</strong> Connect with other families before or immediately after arrival. The forum is one of the best resources for settling in.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_tips_li2"><strong>Check partner work permit eligibility:</strong> Understand the work restrictions associated with your permit type before your partner starts a job search.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_tips_li3"><strong>Apply for family allowances promptly:</strong> Do not delay — submit your allowance applications as soon as you have the required documents.</li>
        <li data-i18n="fms_tips_li4"><strong>Connect with the Welcome Club families section:</strong> The Welcome Club organises activities specifically for families with children and is an excellent way to build a social network.</li>
      </ul>
