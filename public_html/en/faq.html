      <h2 data-i18n="faq_general_title">General</h2>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q1">Where do I collect my CERN access card?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a1">Your CERN access card is collected at the CERN Reception (Building 33). Bring your passport or national ID and your contract documentation. The Users Office will guide you through the process during your first day. See the <a href="https://admin-eguide.web.cern.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CERN Admin e-Guide</a> for details.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q2">Why doesn't my computing account work?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a2">Your CERN computing account may take 24-48 hours to become fully active after creation. If it still doesn't work, try resetting your password at <a href="https://account.cern.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">account.cern.ch</a>. For persistent issues, contact the CERN Service Desk.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q3">Do I need a Swiss bank account?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a3">CERN can pay your salary to a bank account in most countries. A local Swiss or French account is useful for paying rent and local bills. Many CERN employees also use multi-currency digital banks like Wise or Revolut.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q4">What is EDH and how do I use it?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a4">EDH (Electronic Document Handling) is CERN's system for administrative processes: travel requests, leave applications, expense claims, and more. Access it through the CERN intranet. Your supervisor can help you get started with your first requests.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 data-i18n="faq_health_title">Health Insurance</h2>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q5">I live in France — what do I do about health insurance?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a5">You have 3 months from registering your French residence to exercise your "droit d'option" — choosing between CHIS only, the French system (CMU/PUMA), or Swiss LAMal. Most CERN employees choose CHIS only. See our <a href="health-insurance.html">Health Insurance guide</a> for full details.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q6">Can I change my health insurance choice later?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a6">Generally no. The droit d'option choice is normally irreversible as long as your situation stays the same (same employer, same country of residence). A change of circumstances (e.g., moving from France to Switzerland) may allow a new choice.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q7">How do I submit a CHIS reimbursement claim?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a7">Submit claims through the CHIS online portal or send paper forms to the CHIS office at CERN. Always keep original receipts and prescriptions. Reimbursement typically covers 80-90% of eligible costs.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 data-i18n="faq_housing_title">Housing &amp; Transport</h2>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q8">Should I live in Switzerland or France?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a8">Both have advantages. Switzerland (Geneva) is closer to CERN and has excellent public transport but is very expensive. France (Pays de Gex) is much more affordable but may require a car. See our <a href="housing-guide.html">Housing guide</a> for a detailed comparison.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q9">How do I get a transport pass?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a9">For Geneva public transport (TPG), purchase a Unireso monthly pass at TPG offices or online at tpg.ch. CERN may offer subsidised transport passes — check with HR. Lines 66 and 68 serve CERN directly.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q10">Is a car necessary?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a10">Not if you live in Geneva or close to a bus line serving CERN. If you live in some parts of the Pays de Gex (France), a car is very helpful as public transport options are more limited. CERN also runs internal shuttle buses between its sites.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 data-i18n="faq_legal_title">Legal &amp; Admin</h2>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q11">Do I need to register at a commune/mairie?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a11">Yes. If you live in Switzerland, register at your commune's Office de la population. If you live in France, register at the mairie of your town. CERN staff in Switzerland receive a carte de legitimation instead of a standard residence permit.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q12">What is the carte de legitimation?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a12">The carte de legitimation is a special identity document issued by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs to international organisation employees. It replaces a standard residence permit and grants certain privileges, including exemption from Swiss income tax and LAMal.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q13">Do I need to file taxes in France?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a13">If you live in France, you must file an annual French tax return even though your CERN salary is exempt from French income tax. You declare your situation and the exemption applies. Other income (rental, investments) may be taxable in France.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 data-i18n="faq_tech_title">Tech</h2>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q14">How do I connect to eduroam Wi-Fi?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a14">Use your CERN credentials (username@cern.ch and your CERN password) to connect to the eduroam network. For the best setup, use the eduroam CAT tool at cat.eduroam.org. The CERN-GUEST network is available as a fallback.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q15">How do I access lxplus from home?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a15">Connect via SSH: <code>ssh username@lxplus.cern.ch</code>. You will need Kerberos authentication or an SSH key configured in your CERN account. See our <a href="technical/kerberos-ssh.html">Kerberos &amp; SSH guide</a> for setup instructions.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary data-i18n="faq_q16">What is ServiceNow?</summary>
        <p data-i18n="faq_a16">ServiceNow is CERN's central platform for IT support tickets, HR requests, facility issues, and general service requests. Access it at cern.service-now.com using your CERN credentials. It replaces the old ticketing system.</p>
