      <div class="alert">
        <p data-i18n="sft_alert">All newcomers <strong>must</strong> complete mandatory safety training before being granted access to CERN sites. Plan to start the online modules as early as possible.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 data-i18n="sft_mandatory_title">Mandatory Safety Course</h2>
      <p data-i18n="sft_mandatory_p1">Every person working at CERN must complete a <strong>general safety awareness course</strong> before being allowed to access the sites. This course covers the essential topics you need to stay safe on CERN premises, including fire safety and evacuation procedures, electrical hazard awareness, radiation awareness fundamentals, and emergency contacts and reporting.</p>
      <p data-i18n="sft_mandatory_p2">The course has both an <strong>online component</strong> (e-learning) and an <strong>on-site component</strong>. You can begin the online portion before arriving at CERN, which is strongly recommended to speed up the registration process once you are here.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="sft_types_title">Types of Safety Training</h2>
      <p data-i18n="sft_types_p1">Depending on your role and the areas you will work in, you may need additional training beyond the general course. <strong>General Safety (Level 1)</strong> is mandatory for all personnel and covers basic site safety, fire prevention, and evacuation. If your work involves accelerator tunnels or experimental areas, you will also need <strong>Radiation Protection</strong> training at Level 2 or 3, depending on your exposure category.</p>
      <p data-i18n="sft_types_p2"><strong>Electrical Safety</strong> training is required for anyone working on or near electrical installations, while <strong>Cryogenics Safety</strong> is needed if you work near cryogenic systems, especially around the LHC. Personnel handling chemical substances in laboratories must complete <strong>Chemical Safety</strong> training, and tasks involving ladders, scaffolding, or elevated platforms require a <strong>Working at Heights</strong> course.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="sft_elearning_title">E-Learning Platform</h2>
      <p data-i18n="sft_elearning_p1">CERN provides safety e-learning modules through the <strong>Learning Hub</strong> platform. These modules can be completed before your arrival, allowing you to begin work more quickly once on site. When you log in, mandatory modules are flagged clearly in your training profile, and certificates are stored automatically upon completion.</p>
      <p data-i18n="sft_elearning_p2">The platform also lets you track your overall progress and see upcoming deadlines for renewals or new requirements. Taking advantage of the e-learning modules early is one of the best ways to ensure a smooth start at CERN.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="sft_onsite_title">On-Site Training</h2>
      <p data-i18n="sft_onsite_p1">Some safety courses include practical on-site sessions that cannot be replaced by e-learning. These sessions give you hands-on experience with safety equipment and procedures, such as <strong>fire extinguisher handling</strong>, building-specific evacuation drills, and safety briefings from your building's safety officer.</p>
      <p data-i18n="sft_onsite_p2">To arrange these sessions, coordinate with your supervisor or contact the <strong>HSE unit</strong> directly. On-site training is typically scheduled during your first weeks, so plan accordingly to complete it as early as possible.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="sft_renewal_title">Certification Renewal</h2>
      <p data-i18n="sft_renewal_p1">Safety certifications are not permanent and must be renewed periodically to ensure your knowledge stays current. Most general certifications are valid for <strong>3 to 5 years</strong>, while radiation protection training typically requires renewal every <strong>3 years</strong>.</p>
      <p data-i18n="sft_renewal_p2">The system sends you an automatic notification before your certification expires, so you have time to plan. Re-certification usually involves retaking the e-learning module and, in some cases, repeating the on-site practical session as well.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="sft_hazards_title">Specific Hazards at CERN</h2>
      <p data-i18n="sft_hazards_p1">CERN is a unique environment with hazards not found in typical workplaces. The site includes <strong>supervised and controlled radiation areas</strong> that require specific training and dosimetry equipment before entry. The LHC operates at extremely low temperatures, meaning <strong>cryogenic leaks</strong> can displace oxygen and cause cold burns in certain areas.</p>
      <p data-i18n="sft_hazards_p2"><strong>High-voltage electrical equipment</strong> is present in many locations, and only qualified personnel may work on these systems. Some areas have restricted ventilation and are classified as <strong>confined spaces</strong>, requiring a permit and specific training to enter. Experimental halls also use <strong>overhead cranes</strong> and heavy lifting equipment, so you should always stay clear of marked zones during operations.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="sft_rules_title">Safety Rules on Site</h2>
      <p data-i18n="sft_rules_p1">While on site, you must wear your <strong>CERN badge visibly</strong> at all times and follow all zone access restrictions. Never enter areas you are not authorized for, and never enter the accelerator tunnel without explicit authorization.</p>
      <p data-i18n="sft_rules_p2">If you witness any incident or unsafe situation, report it immediately to your <strong>safety officer</strong>. Make sure you know the contact details of your building safety officer and the <strong>CERN Fire Brigade</strong> (phone 74444) from your first day on site.</p>
