      </div>

      <h2 data-i18n="med_medical_service_title">CERN Medical Service</h2>
      <p data-i18n="med_medical_service_p1">The <strong>CERN Medical Service</strong> is located in Building 57 on the Meyrin site and serves as the primary healthcare facility for everyone working at CERN. It provides occupational health services, general medical consultations, vaccinations, and medical certificates. The service is open <strong>Monday to Friday, from 8:00 to 12:00 and 13:30 to 17:00</strong>, and remains closed on weekends and CERN closure days.</p>
      <p data-i18n="med_medical_service_p2">Appointments can be booked by phone or through the CERN Medical Service website, and walk-ins may be accepted depending on availability. It is important to note that the Medical Service <strong>does not provide emergency care outside of opening hours</strong>. If you need urgent medical attention after hours, you should call the CERN Fire Brigade at 74444 or go directly to a hospital.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="med_infirmary_title">CERN Infirmary</h2>
      <p data-i18n="med_infirmary_p1">The CERN Infirmary provides <strong>first aid and treatment for minor injuries</strong> and ailments on site during working hours. It can handle minor cuts, bruises, headaches, and similar non-urgent conditions, but it is not equipped for serious injuries or emergencies.</p>
      <p data-i18n="med_infirmary_p2">If you experience a minor health issue during the workday, the infirmary should be your first stop. For anything more serious, contact the CERN Fire Brigade at <strong>74444</strong> or go to a hospital directly.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="med_emergency_title">Emergency at CERN</h2>
      <p data-i18n="med_emergency_p1">In any emergency on site, dial <strong>74444</strong> from an internal CERN phone, or <strong>+41 22 767 4444</strong> from a mobile phone. This connects you to the <strong>CERN Fire Brigade</strong>, which coordinates all emergency responses on site. The Fire Brigade is trained to handle medical emergencies, fires, chemical spills, and other incidents, and they are available <strong>24 hours a day, 7 days a week</strong>.</p>
      <p data-i18n="med_emergency_p2"><strong>Automated external defibrillators</strong> (AEDs) are available at various locations across the CERN site -- look for the green AED signs in buildings. If an emergency occurs, call 74444, state your location clearly including the building and room number, describe the situation, and do not hang up until told to do so. If possible, send someone to meet the emergency team at the building entrance.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="med_hospitals_title">Hospitals</h2>
      <p data-i18n="med_hospitals_p1">The main hospital in the area is <strong>HUG</strong> (Hopitaux Universitaires de Geneve), which has a <strong>24/7 emergency department</strong>. It is located at Rue Gabrielle-Perret-Gentil 4, 1205 Geneva, and is accessible by tram 15 or bus. For those living on the French side, the <strong>Centre Hospitalier du Pays de Gex</strong> in Gex is closer to CERN and has an emergency department for less critical cases.</p>
      <p data-i18n="med_hospitals_p2">Several <strong>medical centres and clinics</strong> in Meyrin and the surrounding areas also offer walk-in appointments and minor urgent care during business hours, which can be a convenient option for non-emergency situations.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="med_doctor_title">Finding a Doctor</h2>
      <p data-i18n="med_doctor_p1">To find a <strong>general practitioner</strong> (medecin generaliste), you can register with a local doctor near your residence. In Switzerland, you do not always need a referral to see a specialist, though some insurance plans may require one. You can use online directories or ask your commune for a list of doctors accepting new patients, but be aware that <strong>waiting lists can be long</strong> in the Geneva area.</p>
      <p data-i18n="med_doctor_p2">If you live in France, it is recommended to register with a <strong>medecin traitant</strong> (primary care doctor) through the French healthcare system, as this ensures you receive full reimbursement rates. The CERN Medical Service can also recommend doctors and specialists in the area -- just ask at your next appointment or contact them by phone.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="med_pharmacies_title">Pharmacies</h2>
      <p data-i18n="med_pharmacies_p1">Several pharmacies are located in <strong>Meyrin and Vernier</strong>, close to CERN on the Swiss side, where they dispense prescriptions from Swiss or CERN doctors during standard business hours. On the French side, pharmacies in <strong>Saint-Genis-Pouilly and Ferney-Voltaire</strong> accept French prescriptions and some Swiss prescriptions.</p>
      <p data-i18n="med_pharmacies_p2">If you need a pharmacy on a Sunday, holiday, or at night, a rotating <strong>pharmacie de garde</strong> schedule determines which one is open -- you can check the schedule online or on any pharmacy door. Prescriptions from the CERN Medical Service are generally accepted at both Swiss and French pharmacies. Always keep your <strong>CHIS card</strong> with you for reimbursement purposes.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="med_mental_health_title">Mental Health</h2>
      <p data-i18n="med_mental_health_p1">CERN provides <strong>psychological support</strong> through its Medical Service, where you can request an appointment with a psychologist using the standard booking process. In addition, CERN offers a confidential <strong>Employee Assistance Programme (EAP)</strong> that provides short-term counselling, crisis support, and referral services. The EAP is available to all CERN personnel and their family members.</p>
      <p data-i18n="med_mental_health_p2">External resources, including private psychologists and psychiatrists in the Geneva area, are also available, and the CERN Medical Service can provide referrals. All mental health consultations -- whether through the Medical Service or the EAP -- are <strong>strictly confidential</strong> and are never shared with your supervisor or HR department.</p>
