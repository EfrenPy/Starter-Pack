      <h2 data-i18n="ret_before_title">Before Leaving Geneva (3-6 months before)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="ret_before_li1"><strong>Notify CERN HR:</strong> Inform your supervisor and HR department of your departure date. Confirm end-of-contract formalities, final salary payment, and any leaving indemnity or pension options.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_before_li2"><strong>Request certificates:</strong> Obtain your CERN employment certificate, internal tax certificates for all years worked, and a pension fund statement showing your accumulated rights and options.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_before_li3"><strong>Baja consular:</strong> Visit the Spanish Consulate to process your consular de-registration (baja consular). This formally records your return to Spain and is needed for certain administrative steps back home.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_before_li4"><strong>Convenio especial:</strong> If you have been paying the convenio especial with Spanish Social Security, decide whether to continue it until your return date or terminate it once you are back and re-employed in Spain.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_before_li5"><strong>Medical records:</strong> Collect your complete medical records, prescriptions, and any ongoing treatment documentation from CERN CHIS. Request a coverage end-date certificate from CHIS.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_before_li6"><strong>Pension fund options:</strong> Review your CERN Pension Fund options: deferred pension, lump-sum withdrawal, or transfer. Deadlines for certain elections may apply, so consult the Pension Fund office early.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_before_li7"><strong>Notify your commune:</strong> De-register from your Swiss commune (or French mairie). Return your carte de legitimation and cancel any local insurance, utilities, and subscriptions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="ret_arrival_title">Administrative Steps on Arrival in Spain</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="ret_arrival_li1"><strong>Empadronamiento:</strong> Register at your local town hall (ayuntamiento) as soon as you have a residential address in Spain. The padron certificate is essential for healthcare, voting, and other services.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_arrival_li2"><strong>Certificado de emigrante retornado:</strong> Apply at the Delegacion or Subdelegacion del Gobierno for a returning emigrant certificate. This document can unlock certain benefits and is proof of your time spent abroad.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_arrival_li3"><strong>DNI update:</strong> Update your DNI with your new Spanish address at a police station (comisaria). If your DNI has expired while abroad, renew it as a priority since it is required for most administrative procedures.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="ret_healthcare_title">Healthcare &amp; Social Security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="ret_healthcare_li1"><strong>Re-entering the healthcare system:</strong> Once empadronado, visit your local Social Security office (INSS or CAISS) to register for public healthcare. If you maintained the convenio especial, you should have continuity of coverage. Otherwise, you may need to register as a resident without resources or wait until you start employment.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_healthcare_li2"><strong>Convenio especial coverage:</strong> If you maintained the convenio especial, your healthcare and pension rights remain active. Present your convenio documentation and padron certificate at the INSS to confirm your status.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_healthcare_li3"><strong>SEPE path:</strong> If you return without employment, register at SEPE (public employment service) as a jobseeker. This is a prerequisite for accessing certain benefits and active employment programmes, even if you do not qualify for unemployment benefits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="ret_sepe_title">Employment &amp; Unemployment (SEPE)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="ret_sepe_li1"><strong>Register at SEPE:</strong> As a returning emigrant, register as a jobseeker (demandante de empleo) at your local SEPE office. Bring your returning emigrant certificate, padron, DNI, and CERN employment certificate.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_sepe_li2"><strong>CERN years do NOT count for paro:</strong> Time at CERN does not generate Spanish unemployment benefit rights, since no unemployment contributions were paid to Spain. You cannot claim prestacion por desempleo based on CERN employment alone.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_sepe_li3"><strong>EU coordination:</strong> EU social security coordination regulations do not apply to CERN employment because CERN is outside national social security systems. If you previously had Spanish unemployment contributions within the last six years, check whether those older contributions are still within the look-back window to qualify for benefits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="ret_pension_title">CERN Pension: Options &amp; Spanish Taxation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="ret_pension_li1"><strong>Deferred pension:</strong> If you are vested in the CERN Pension Fund (typically after five years of service), you can leave your benefits in the fund and draw a pension when you reach CERN retirement age. The pension will be paid monthly by CERN.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_pension_li2"><strong>Lump sum:</strong> You may be eligible to withdraw a lump-sum leaving allowance instead of a deferred pension, depending on your length of service and the fund rules at the time. Consult the Pension Fund office for details and tax implications.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_pension_li3"><strong>Transfer:</strong> In certain cases, you may be able to transfer your CERN pension rights to another pension scheme. This option is limited and subject to specific agreements between CERN and the receiving institution.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_pension_li4"><strong>IRPF taxation:</strong> Unlike CERN salaries (which are exempt), CERN pensions received by Spanish tax residents are subject to IRPF. Spain considers the CERN pension as rendimientos del trabajo and taxes it under the standard income tax brackets. Plan accordingly, as the net amount will be lower than the gross pension.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="ret_financial_title">Financial &amp; Practical Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="ret_financial_li1"><strong>Closing bank accounts:</strong> Close or restructure your Swiss and French bank accounts as needed. Some people keep a foreign account for pension payments or ongoing obligations. Notify your banks of your change of tax residence.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_financial_li2"><strong>Transferring savings:</strong> Use low-cost transfer services (Wise, Revolut) to move savings from CHF or EUR accounts to your Spanish bank. Be aware of large-transfer reporting requirements in Spain (Modelo S-1 for transfers above 10,000 euros).</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_financial_li3"><strong>Importing your car:</strong> If you bring a vehicle registered abroad into Spain, you must register it with the DGT (Direccion General de Trafico) within 30 days. You may be exempt from import duties if you qualify as a returning resident (under the household goods exemption), but you must apply at customs (Aduana) with proof of your foreign residence.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_financial_li4"><strong>Household goods:</strong> Returning emigrants can import personal belongings duty-free if they have lived abroad for at least 12 months. Prepare an inventory and present it at customs along with your returning emigrant certificate and proof of prior residence abroad.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 data-i18n="ret_taxyear_title">Tax Implications of the Return Year</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-i18n="ret_taxyear_li1"><strong>Full tax resident:</strong> Spain determines tax residence for the full calendar year. If you return before July, you will likely be considered tax resident for the entire year and must declare your worldwide income for that year.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_taxyear_li2"><strong>Exempt months:</strong> CERN salary received during the months you were still a CERN employee remains exempt under the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities. Only non-CERN income and any Spanish employment income after your return are taxable.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_taxyear_li3"><strong>Modelo 720:</strong> If you still hold foreign assets above the 50,000 euro threshold on 31 December of the return year, you must file Modelo 720 in the following year (January-March). This includes Swiss or French bank accounts, CERN pension fund rights, and foreign property.</li>
        <li data-i18n="ret_taxyear_li4"><strong>First IRPF declaration:</strong> In your first Spanish tax return after returning, declare your worldwide income for the year, applying the CERN salary exemption for the months worked at CERN. Attach the CERN internal tax certificate and any other documentation supporting the exemption.</li>
      </ul>
