      <h2 data-i18n="hsg_areas_title">Popular Areas</h2>
      <h3 data-i18n="hsg_areas_ch_title">In Switzerland</h3>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_areas_ch_p1"><strong>Meyrin</strong> is the closest town to CERN's main entrance, offering a short commute, local shops and markets, and a suburban feel that makes it the most popular choice among CERN employees. Nearby, <strong>Vernier</strong> provides a more affordable alternative by Geneva standards, with good bus connections to CERN and a multicultural, residential atmosphere.</p>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_areas_ch_p2">If you prefer city life, <strong>Geneva centre</strong> offers vibrant amenities and nightlife, though rents are higher and the commute to CERN runs about 20-30 minutes by bus. <strong>Carouge</strong>, a charming neighbourhood south of the centre, is known for its artistic atmosphere and good restaurants. The commute is slightly longer but well served by tram.</p>
      <h3 data-i18n="hsg_areas_fr_title">In France</h3>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_areas_fr_p1"><strong>Saint-Genis-Pouilly</strong> sits directly adjacent to CERN and is home to many CERN employees. It has good local amenities, supermarkets, and schools, with a short drive or bus ride to the lab. <strong>Ferney-Voltaire</strong> is a charming town with good schools and restaurants, close to the Swiss border and Geneva airport, making it especially popular with international families.</p>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_areas_fr_p2">Further into the Pays de Gex, <strong>Gex</strong> is a small historic town at the foot of the Jura mountains, quieter and more rural, with a weekly market and a slightly longer commute. <strong>Thoiry</strong> offers good-value housing close to skiing and outdoor activities in the Jura, with a growing community of CERN families. For those willing to trade a longer commute for lower rents, <strong>Annemasse</strong> is a larger town on the French-Swiss border south of Geneva, connected by the Leman Express train.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="hsg_finding_title">Finding Housing</h2>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_finding_p1">Your first stop should be the <strong>CERN Housing Service</strong>, which maintains a list of available rentals and can assist newcomers with the search. Check the CERN internal website or contact the Users Office for details. Temporary on-site accommodation at the <strong>CERN hostel</strong> may also be available for your first weeks while you look for a permanent home.</p>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_finding_p2">For independent searching, useful websites include <strong>homegate.ch</strong>, <strong>immoscout24.ch</strong>, and <strong>comparis.ch</strong> on the Swiss side, and <strong>seloger.com</strong>, <strong>leboncoin.fr</strong>, and <strong>bien-ici.com</strong> in France. The internal CERN Market and local Facebook groups (search for "CERN Housing", "Expats in Geneva", or "Pays de Gex Expats") are also valuable resources where other CERN employees often share listings and advice.</p>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_finding_p3">Be cautious of <strong>rental scams</strong>. Listings that seem too good to be true, request money upfront before a viewing, or use suspicious payment methods are red flags. Always visit the property in person before signing any contract.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="hsg_transport_title">Transport</h2>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_transport_p1">Public transport in the Geneva area is run by <strong>TPG</strong> (Transports Publics Genevois), which operates buses and trams. Lines 66 and 68 serve CERN directly. The <strong>Unireso</strong> integrated fare system covers TPG buses and trams, SBB trains, and Mouettes boats across the Greater Geneva area, with monthly passes available for different zones.</p>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_transport_p2">If you live south of the border, the <strong>Leman Express</strong> regional train connects Geneva with surrounding French towns such as Annemasse and the Annecy corridor. Within CERN itself, <strong>free shuttle buses</strong> run between the Meyrin and Prevessin campuses for all CERN personnel.</p>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_transport_p3">The area around CERN is generally flat and <strong>cycle-friendly</strong>, with bike racks at most buildings and a bike-sharing scheme in Geneva (Donkey Republic/Velospot). Many people living in France commute by <strong>car</strong> instead. Parking is available at CERN but can be limited, and cross-border commuters typically need a <strong>G permit</strong> for Switzerland.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="hsg_health_title">Health Insurance</h2>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_health_p1">The <strong>CERN Health Insurance Scheme (CHIS)</strong> is your primary coverage. It covers medical expenses in Switzerland, France, and abroad, and all CERN employees and their registered dependents are enrolled automatically.</p>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_health_p2">CERN staff holding a <strong>carte de legitimation</strong> are exempt from Swiss mandatory health insurance (<strong>LAMal</strong>) and do not need to enrol. However, family members without CERN status who work in Switzerland may need their own LAMal coverage. On the French side, CERN employees living in France are generally exempt from compulsory affiliation to <strong>CMU/PUMA</strong> (French universal healthcare) thanks to CHIS. If your partner works in France outside CERN, they would join the French system separately.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="hsg_banking_title">Banking</h2>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_banking_p1">If you live in Switzerland, traditional banks such as <strong>UBS</strong> and <strong>BCGE</strong> are useful for receiving your salary in CHF and paying Swiss rent, though they often require Swiss residency and charge significant fees. CERN may help with introductions to local banks. Those living in France will need a French account for rent payments and direct debits, with options including <strong>BNP Paribas</strong>, <strong>Societe Generale</strong>, and online banks like Boursorama and Fortuneo.</p>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_banking_p2">Many CERN employees also use <strong>digital banks</strong> such as Wise, Revolut, and N26 for low-fee currency exchange between CHF and EUR and for international transfers. These are particularly handy for managing cross-border finances on a daily basis.</p>

      <h2 data-i18n="hsg_groceries_title">Groceries &amp; Shopping</h2>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_groceries_p1">On the Swiss side, <strong>Migros</strong> and <strong>Coop</strong> are the main supermarket chains, while <strong>Lidl</strong> and <strong>Aldi</strong> offer lower prices. Shopping in Switzerland is significantly more expensive than in France, so many Swiss residents cross the border to buy groceries at <strong>Carrefour</strong>, <strong>Leclerc</strong>, <strong>Lidl</strong>, and <strong>Intermarche</strong> in the Pays de Gex area.</p>
      <p data-i18n="hsg_groceries_p2">On campus, CERN has several <strong>restaurants and cafeterias</strong> (Restaurant 1, Restaurant 2, etc.) offering affordable meals. Coffee corners and vending machines are available throughout the campus for quick breaks.</p>
