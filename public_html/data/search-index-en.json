Please consult a qualified advisor for your specific situation. Beginning a new position at CERN – whether in Geneva, Switzerland or in Pays de Gex, France – involves unique administrative steps for Spanish nationals. CERN is an international organization with its own internal tax and social security systems, which means your situation will differ from a typical job in Spain or the EU. This guide provides a practical roadmap focusing on social security and tax obligations, covering what to do from the Spanish perspective, the differences between being based in Switzerland vs. France, and the implications for short-term vs. long-term stays. We also include example scenarios and key resources to help you navigate the bureaucracy smoothly. Before You Move: Spanish Social Security Registration &amp; Preparations Before relocating, Spanish nationals should take a few steps to ensure compliance and protect their rights: Register at the Spanish Consulate: If you move abroad, inform the Spanish authorities by registering as a resident at the nearest Spanish Embassy/Consulate. This \"consular registration\" is required for certain processes (e.g., signing up for special social security agreements) and ensures you remain on record as an emigrant. It also provides access to consular services while abroad. Spanish Social Security – Convenio Especial (voluntary coverage): When you work at CERN, you will not be contributing to the Spanish Social Security system by default (CERN has its own pension and insurance schemes). To avoid gaps in your Spanish social security record, you can voluntarily continue contributing in Spain via a Convenio Especial for emigrants (special agreement). This is a personal agreement with the Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social (TGSS) that allows you to pay monthly contributions to maintain coverage for certain benefits: What it covers: The convenio especial for Spanish emigrants covers retirement ( jubilación ), permanent disability, and death/survivor pensions. It also ensures you retain access to public healthcare in Spain as an emigrant. Note: It does not cover unemployment benefits or temporary disability, since you won't be paying into those contingencies. Cost: You pay the contributions yourself (no employer contribution). The cost is based on the minimum contribution base and standard rate, with a reduction factor. For example, in 2024 the minimum base is €1,323/month; applying the 28.3% rate and reduction coefficient (0.77) yields about €288 per month (paid quarterly, ~€864/quarter). This amount may adjust over time as bases and rates change. How to sign up: You must apply for the convenio within 90 days of leaving your last job in Spain (to avoid gaps). Fill out model TA.0040 (Convenio Especial application) and submit it to TGSS. You can do this via the Seguridad Social Electronic Office (Import@ss) or through the provincial TGSS office (often via mail or the labor attaché at the consulate). Along with the form, you'll need to provide: A copy of your DNI or passport. Proof of your residence abroad (e.g. a copy of your CERN legitimation card or French residence document), certified by the Spanish consulate. Proof of employment or research activity at CERN (such as your CERN contract or a certificate of employment), also endorsed by the consulate. If you weren't previously in the Spanish system, you may also submit a TA.1 form to get a social security number. Effect of signing the convenio: Once approved, you'll be affiliated to the Spanish system in an \"assimilated high\" status (as if you were employed for covered contingencies). You must pay the quarterly bills that TGSS will issue (ensure you have a Spanish bank account for the direct debit). The convenio remains in effect as long as you keep paying, until you terminate it or return and resume normal contributions. It can typically be suspended or ended if you stop paying or if you become a pensioner, etc., per the rules. If you do NOT sign the convenio: It's not mandatory – it's a personal decision. However, be aware that not contributing in Spain means that period won't count for your Spanish pension. You will be relying solely on CERN's own pension scheme for those years. If you already have contributions in Spain or plan to return to Spain in the future, consider how a gap of a few years will affect your \"cotización\" record. (For example, if you had 12 years of contributions in Spain, spent 3 years at CERN with no Spanish contributions, then returned to work in Spain, you'd still have 12 years on record — potentially below the 15-year minimum for a Spanish state pension.) In contrast, maintaining contributions via the convenio would give you continuous coverage and a larger total for pension calculation later. Short-term (&lt;2 years) vs Long-term (&gt;2 years) stays: If your CERN position is short (e.g. a 1–2 year fellowship), you might weigh the cost-benefit of the convenio especial. A short gap in contributions may have a minor impact on a 30+ year career, especially if you plan to work longer to reach retirement age. In some cases, Spaniards on very short assignments might even keep their Spanish residence or be on unpaid leave ( excedencia ) from a Spanish job – but in most cases a CERN fellow is a standalone job. For longer stays (beyond 2 years) or an indefinite contract, it's generally advisable to maintain the Spanish social security link via the convenio if you intend to eventually return to Spain, since the gap could significantly affect pension entitlements. Remember that under EU rules, workers posted by a Spanish employer abroad can stay in home-country social security up to 24 months, but CERN employment is not a posting by Spain – it's a direct job, so that EU \"A1 certificate\" system does not apply here. The convenio especial is the mechanism for continued Spanish coverage once you leave the Spanish system. With these preparations in mind, let's break down the specifics for each scenario: working at CERN in Switzerland vs. France, as the host country can affect certain practical requirements. Scenario 1: Working at CERN in Switzerland (Geneva) Figure: A satellite image of the CERN area, with the 27-km Large Hadron Collider ring (yellow circle) beneath the French–Swiss border near Geneva. Spanish CERN staff in Geneva benefit from international status, affecting tax and social security obligations. Social Security (Spain &amp; Switzerland) If your CERN contract lists your duty station as Geneva (Switzerland), you will receive a Swiss legitimation card (a diplomatic-type ID for international officials) and will not pay into Swiss social security. In fact, neither you nor CERN will contribute to any national social security system (Swiss or Spanish) for your CERN salary – CERN has its own comprehensive system for pensions and insurance. Key points include: CERN Pension Fund &amp; Health Insurance: As a CERN fellow/staff, you're automatically covered by CERN's internal schemes. The CERN Pension Fund is a defined-benefit plan that provides for old-age and disability pensions, similar to a state social security pension. CERN also provides a Health Insurance Scheme (CHIS) for illness, accidents, and maternity. This internal health insurance covers treatment in both Switzerland and France (and abroad for travel), so you and your dependents are well protected. Exemption from Swiss systems: Under the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities (which Spain and Switzerland have ratified), CERN and its staff are exempt from compulsory contributions to national social security. This means you do not pay Swiss pension (AVS/AHV), unemployment, or Swiss health insurance. Normally, residents in Switzerland must take out Swiss health insurance (LAMal), but CERN personnel with a legitimation card are exempt from that requirement. You may voluntarily purchase Swiss health insurance if you wish, but this is usually unnecessary because CERN's CHIS is adequate. (Family members with legitimation cards are also exempt from Swiss health insurance mandates, while those without such status – e.g. a spouse working in the local economy – would need coverage under Swiss or French rules.) Spanish Social Security obligations: From Spain's point of view, once you start working in Geneva you are considered an emigrant worker. You will have been given a \"baja\" in Spanish Social Security when you left your last job in Spain. Because of CERN's special status, you will not be paying Spanish social security through any automatic mechanism. The onus is on you to arrange coverage via the Convenio Especial if you want to keep contributing in Spain (see \"Before You Move\" above). Spain does not require any other social security registration while you're abroad, apart from the voluntary convenio. It's recommended to keep evidence of your CERN employment (contracts, CERN HR letters) and the consular registration, in case Spanish authorities request proof that you were employed abroad (e.g. for validating your convenio especial or when you eventually claim a pension). Coverage and benefits: While in Switzerland, your day-to-day social security needs (healthcare, family allowances, etc.) are largely handled by CERN internally. For example, CERN provides family/child allowances and has internal rules for maternity/paternity leave, disability insurance, etc. This means you typically won't interact with Swiss social security for benefits. If you need medical care in Switzerland or France, you use the CERN health insurance (which reimburses costs; you might also get a CERN-issued insurance card). If you travel back to Spain for visits, you can use your CHIS coverage for emergency care or scheduled care (CHIS might reimburse or you could use private services). Note that since you're not paying into Spanish social security (unless via convenio), you generally wouldn't use a Spanish Tarjeta Sanitaria as a resident (unless you maintain residency in Spain, which most do not). If you did sign the convenio especial, you have the right to healthcare in Spain as an emigrant, so you could obtain documentation (an S1 form or equivalent) to show that Spain covers your health while abroad. However, because CERN's health insurance is primary, in practice many do not utilize the Spanish health system until they return home. It's good to know that signing the convenio keeps your Spanish public healthcare access alive for when you return. Short vs long stay considerations: For Geneva postings under ~2 years, you might feel the Spanish convenio is optional – for a brief fellowship, some people choose not to pay €288/month and accept a small gap in pension contributions. If you plan to return to Spain soon, also consider unemployment (addressed below): a short stint might leave you without coverage for unemployment benefits on return, since you paid no Spanish unemployment contributions while at CERN. For longer appointments or permanent positions, maintaining Spanish contributions can be very important if you intend to retire in Spain or need to ensure continuity of your pension rights. 💡 Example: María worked 5 years in Spain before her 3-year CERN fellowship in Geneva. She decided not to sign the convenio during those 3 years. When she returns to Spain, she has still only 5 years of contributions in Spanish Social Security (her CERN time doesn't count). She will need at least 10 more years of work in Spain to reach the 15-year minimum for a Spanish pension. Had she contributed via the convenio during CERN, she would have 8 years on record, needing 7 more. In María's case, if she is confident she'll work many years in Spain after CERN, she might save money by not paying the convenio; but if her post-CERN plans are uncertain, the convenio would have safeguarded her pension eligibility. Tax Obligations in Switzerland (and Spain) One of the biggest adjustments for CERN staff is the tax regime, which is very different from normal employment. CERN levies its own internal tax on your salary, and in return the Host States and Member States do not tax your CERN income. Here's what to know for the Swiss scenario: No Swiss income tax on CERN earnings: Each month, CERN deducts an internal tax (analogous to an income tax) from your salary according to its own scale. Because of this, the salary and family allowances paid by CERN are exempt from Swiss federal, cantonal, and communal taxes. In practical terms, you do not file a Swiss income tax return if CERN is your only income and you are a foreign national. The Geneva tax authorities don't require non-Swiss CERN staff to file a return in most cases. ( Exceptions: if you have significant outside income or property in Switzerland, you might need to declare those. For example, owning Swiss real estate or having a side business could trigger an obligation to file a Swiss return, declaring those external incomes. But your CERN salary itself remains tax-free in Switzerland.) Swiss members of CERN's personnel do file but likewise do not list CERN income, only noting they are internally taxed. Internal taxation certificate: CERN will provide you each year with an \"Internal Taxation Certificate\" stating that your CERN income was subject to internal tax. If you ever are asked by a Swiss tax office to prove your status, you can supply this certificate. Typically, non-Swiss employees residing in Switzerland won't even receive a tax form from the canton unless they have other taxable income. If you inadvertently get one, you usually just inform the tax office of your status. (Swiss spouses of CERN staff living in Switzerland may have to file and declare the situation – they themselves are exempt on CERN income but still must report other income or assets.) Spanish taxation of CERN income: Spain is a CERN Member State and is a signatory to the Privileges Protocol. If you remain a tax resident of Spain while working at CERN, your CERN remuneration is exempt from Spanish income tax as well. In practice, however, most fellows who move to Geneva will become non-resident in Spain for tax purposes – you'll be living and working abroad full-time. Spain determines tax residency by whether you spend more than 183 days in Spanish territory in the calendar year, among other criteria. Once you move to Geneva and cut ties (e.g. no home, and your family moved with you), you typically become a non-resident of Spain, meaning you won't file annual Spanish IRPF returns at all during your contract. If for some reason you kept Spanish tax residency (for example, your family stayed in Spain and you return often, potentially invoking the \"center of vital interests\" rule), Spanish law still grants an exemption for income from international organizations. Article 10(b) of the CERN Privileges Protocol (ratified by Spain in 2007) explicitly states that CERN salaries are exempt from national income tax, since you pay the internal tax. So either way, your CERN earnings are not taxed by Spain. ( Do note: This exemption applies only to your CERN employment income. If you have other income still sourced in Spain – say you rent out your Spanish flat while in Geneva – that income may still be taxable in Spain or Switzerland depending on the case, so you might have to file a non-resident tax return in Spain for the rent, for example.) Other taxes and practicalities: Even though you don't pay Swiss income tax, if you live in Switzerland you may encounter other local taxes or duties: VAT (IVA): when you purchase goods or services in Switzerland, local VAT applies (though some shopping can be duty-free at CERN stores). CERN privileges don't generally exempt you from paying sales taxes in shops, except under certain conditions on big purchases (there are diplomatic-type tax reliefs on substantial items or on imports for personal effects, as per CERN's status agreements). Communal taxes: Some communes charge minor fees (e.g. garbage fees) unrelated to income. These might apply since you reside there. Vehicle and road taxes: If you register a personal car in Geneva, you pay the canton's road tax, etc. Again, no exemption for those as they're not income taxes. Wealth/asset tax: Geneva (and Switzerland) have an annual wealth tax for residents. If you have significant assets, technically as a resident you might be liable for cantonal wealth tax. However, many CERN foreigners keep assets abroad and/or fall below thresholds. This is a complex area – if relevant, consult the Geneva tax authorities or a tax advisor. (Some international civil servants who are permanent residents handle this; as a fellow on a time-limited stay, it may not apply if your assets are modest.) Tax declaration in Switzerland: As noted, you likely won't file one. Non-Swiss CERN staff residing in Geneva are \"not normally required to complete an income tax declaration form\" unless they have other taxable income or assets. If you do need to file (rare), you would not list CERN income, only other taxable items, and attach the CERN tax certificate. Summary: In Switzerland, your CERN pay is only taxed at the source by CERN. You do not pay Spanish IRPF or Swiss income tax on it, thanks to the international agreement. This often means a higher net income compared to a similar gross salary in a normal job (since CERN's internal tax is usually lower than combined national taxes). Take into account, however, that you won't be contributing to Spanish public pension or unemployment funds during this time (unless you voluntarily do so), as discussed above. It's wise to save a portion of your salary or contribute to the convenio for long-term security. 💡Example Scenario (Switzerland): Carlos, a Spanish junior engineer, gets a 2-year CERN fellowship in Geneva. He leaves his job in Spain and moves to Switzerland. Here's how he handles his obligations: Before leaving: Carlos registers with the Spanish consulate in Geneva and applies online for the convenio especial to keep his Spanish pension contributions going. He provides his CERN offer letter and, a month later upon arrival, a copy of his Swiss legitimation card to the TGSS via the consulate. He starts paying ~€290/month to the Spanish system. In Geneva: Carlos rents an apartment. As a CERN staff member, he is exempt from Swiss health insurance, so he sticks with CERN's CHIS coverage which reimburses his medical bills. He does not register for any Swiss social security; his \"carte de légitimation\" from the Swiss Mission suffices for residency. At tax time: Carlos does not receive a Swiss tax form (since he's a foreign CERN fellow with no other income). He also does not file a Spanish tax return because he spent less than 183 days in Spain and has moved his residence. CERN gives him an internal tax certificate showing he paid CERN internal tax on his income, which he keeps on file. His income isn't taxed by Spain. After 2 years (end of fellowship): Carlos returns to Spain. Thanks to the convenio especial, he has no gap in his Spanish pension record. However, because he voluntarily left Spain for CERN, he did not accumulate any Spanish unemployment rights while abroad. He plans his return knowing he cannot claim \"paro\" immediately (see the \"Returning to Spain\" section below). He budgets savings from his CERN salary to cover him until he finds a new job in Spain. Scenario 2: Working at CERN in France (Pays de Gex / Prévessin) CERN's campus spans both Switzerland and France. Some fellows are contracted to work on the French side (e.g., at CERN's Prévessin site or other facilities in Ain, France). In terms of CERN employment conditions, you remain an international civil servant with the same internal tax and CERN social systems. However, living/working in France introduces a few different administrative steps compared to Switzerland. Social Security (Spain &amp; France) Exemption from French Social Security: Just as in Switzerland, CERN employees in France do not contribute to the French social security regime. France has an agreement with CERN (the 1965 France–CERN Headquarters Agreement) which grants CERN staff immunities. You will not pay into Caisse d'Assurance Maladie, Caisse de Retraite, UNEDIC, etc. for your CERN salary. CERN's internal Pension Fund and CHIS health insurance cover you instead, providing \"equivalent social protection\" as required by the Protocol. This means: You won't have a French sécurité sociale number through CERN employment (since you're not in the French system). Your health coverage is through CHIS, not through CPAM. You won't accumulate French state pension credits or unemployment insurance rights, because no contributions are paid there. Residence in France (EU citizen): As a Spanish citizen, you have the right to reside in France. France typically requires EU nationals staying &gt;3 months to register their residence, but in practice it's straightforward (often just obtaining an EU resident card is optional). However, since you are an international organization official, France may issue you a special carte de légitimation or otherwise attest your status via the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (For example, UN agencies in France issue \"carte PRO\" or similar to staff. CERN staff in France might be covered by the Swiss legitimation card as well – the Swiss \"P\" or \"H\" card types are recognized by France for border crossing and status purposes.) Be sure to clarify with CERN HR what documentation you and your family need to reside in France legally. Usually, with your CERN contract and either the legitimation card or an attestation, you fulfill French requirements without needing a separate work permit. French health insurance (PUMA) opt-out: Normally, residents in France who aren't otherwise covered must join the universal health system (PUMA) and pay contributions or have private insurance. CERN personnel with privileges are exempt from mandatory French health insurance because you already have coverage (CHIS). France recognizes the CERN scheme as adequate. You will want to ensure your CERN health insurance card is valid in France – CHIS does cover treatment in France (CERN requires that any private insurance for users covers both France and Switzerland, and CHIS of course does). If you ever use French medical services, you might pay upfront and get reimbursed by CHIS, since you won't have a French sécurité sociale number to charge directly (unless CERN has direct billing arrangements for some hospitals). Some staff choose to also get the European Health Insurance Card via CHIS for travel in Europe, but note CHIS isn't an EU national scheme, so typically you'd rely on CHIS's own processes for cross-border care. Spanish Social Security considerations: From Spain's perspective, working on the French side of CERN is no different than the Swiss side – you are still not contributing to Spanish Social Security unless by convenio. So all the advice from earlier (\"Before You Move\") on registering and optionally signing the convenio especial applies equally here. One small difference: if you are residing in an EU country (France) while on leave from Spain, there is a coordination mechanism where, had you been sent by a Spanish employer, you would carry an S1 form to transfer healthcare rights. But since you are directly hired by CERN, you cannot get an S1 from Spain (you're not paying Spanish contributions, so Spain won't cover your health in France; CERN covers it instead). Thus, the convenio especial doesn't give you an S1 for France (S1 is only for people remaining under the Spanish system), but it does keep your Spanish health rights for when you return to Spain or if you go there temporarily. In summary, being in France doesn't let you use the EU social security coordination because CERN is outside that system. Administrative note – French Social Security Number: Occasionally, you might need a French Social Security number for certain administrative purposes (for instance, French tax forms ask for a numéro de sécurité sociale as an identifier, or doctors might ask for it). If you're not in the French system, you can usually explain that you are covered by an international organization scheme and thus have no French number. The French tax office can issue a tax identification number (separate from a social security number) for you to file taxes (discussed below). If you later take up non-CERN work in France, you'd then get a social security number at that time. Family considerations (frontier workers): If, for example, your spouse works in Switzerland but you live in France (a common scenario: one spouse at CERN, the other employed by a Swiss company), the spouse would be a frontalier subject to special rules. France usually requires frontier workers or their families to choose either the French or Swiss health system (under bilateral agreements). However, CERN staff and their registered family are treated under the privileges regime – e.g., your spouse holding a \"P\" legitimation card as your family member would also be exempt from mandatory affiliation. If your spouse works outside CERN, they will follow the normal rules for their job (not our focus here). Just be aware that your unique status might confuse local officials (e.g., CPAM might not know what to do with you if you tried to register – the answer is you don't need to). CERN's Users Office and HR can provide guidance on these cross-border family insurance questions. Short vs long stay: Living in France, you might feel more integrated into an EU country, but don't let that give a false sense of social security coverage – you still must actively maintain Spanish contributions if you want, as France gives you no credit for CERN time. If you only stay a short while at CERN (say 1–2 years in France) and then move to another EU job, note that when you later apply for pensions, the French pension office will not have any record of you for those years. And since CERN is not an EU social security institution, you cannot totalize CERN time under EU pension coordination. Plan accordingly with the convenio or by making up years later. Tax Obligations in France (and Spain) As a CERN employee residing in France, you fall under French tax jurisdiction as a resident. France, like Switzerland, exempts CERN salaries from income tax, but you will likely need to file a French tax return to declare your situation. Also, being in the EU, you might still have some ties to Spain to consider. Here's how to manage taxes: French income tax returns: Unlike Geneva, where many foreign CERN folks never file a return, in France you generally must file an annual tax declaration because you are a resident. The good news is that your CERN income is not taxed by France (thanks to privileges), but you do need to report it in a specific way. Each spring, you will fill out a French income tax form (now usually done online). In the form, you do not include your CERN salary under \"salaire imposable.\" Instead, you will tick certain boxes and add a note to inform the tax authorities that your CERN income is tax-exempt due to internal taxation. For example, CERN's guidance (in cooperation with local French tax offices) is that staff should not list their CERN earnings under employment income, and should add an \"information expresse\" note stating: \" Membre du personnel du CERN assujetti à l'impôt interne du CERN et, à ce titre, exonéré d'impôt sur les prestations versées par le CERN \". This explains that you're CERN personnel subject to CERN internal tax and therefore exempt from tax on that income. You will attach your CERN Internal Tax Certificate to the declaration as proof. There are specific boxes in the French form to tick for having foreign exempt income. For instance, you tick the section for \"revenus de source étrangère exonérés\" and provide the amount in the informational fields (it won't be taxed). The exact box numbers can change, but CERN usually provides an e-guide or FAQ each year with instructions. (In the simplest case, as a staff member with only CERN income, you just declare that you have exempt foreign income and supply the internal tax certificate.) Bottom line: you'll probably owe zero income tax in France if CERN was your only earnings. However, if you have other income (like a spouse's salary, rental income, investment income), France will tax those under normal rules. Your French tax rate might be influenced by your total worldwide income (for example, France uses a mechanism where exempt income can be considered to determine your tax rate on other income, via the taux effectif ). But since CERN incomes are typically fully exempt by international convention, in practice France usually just ignores it except for informational purposes. Check the latest guidance or consult the local tax office in Pays de Gex (often the SIP office in Gex or Bellegarde that handles CERN cases) if you have complexity. CERN's admin e-guide provides contacts for the Valserhône SIP (Service des Impôts) which is familiar with CERN personnel cases. Spanish tax residency: When you move to France, you will almost certainly become a tax resident of France (spending &gt;183 days there, having your principal home there). Thus, you would be non-resident in Spain for tax purposes. You should inform the Spanish tax agency by filing Modelo 030 (change of address/tax residence) if you had been filing in Spain, to avoid any confusion. As a non-resident, Spain will only tax any Spanish-source income you have (for example, if you keep a property in Spain and rent it out or sell it, you'd file a non-resident tax return on that income). Otherwise, you won't file annual Spanish returns. And as noted earlier, even if you somehow were considered Spanish tax resident, your CERN salary is exempt by treaty. So either way, Spain will not tax your CERN earnings. You might still want to keep documentation like the BOE publication of the Privileges Protocol or your CERN certificate in case you need to demonstrate the exemption to Spanish authorities at any point. French local taxes: Taxe d'habitation and Taxe foncière: local residency and property taxes. If you rent, usually the taxe d'habitation (residence tax) may apply, though recent reforms have eliminated most of it for primary residences. If you buy property, taxe foncière (land tax) applies. CERN status does not exempt these – you pay them like any resident. VAT and duties: All your purchases in France include TVA (VAT). No exemption (except you might be able to shop in CERN's duty-free shop on the Swiss side for certain goods, but that's minor). If importing personal goods to France when you move, your status might ease customs, but generally EU free movement already covers that for EU citizens. Social charges: France sometimes levies social charges (CSG/CRDS) on investment income or capital gains, even for exempt individuals. However, as an international official and non-French EU citizen, you may be able to avoid some of these if not in the French social system. This is a niche issue: e.g., if you have savings interest or rental income in France, usually residents pay CSG on it. There have been court cases exempting those not in the French social security system from CSG on foreign income. If this applies (say you earn interest in Spain but are a French resident), seek tax advice – it's beyond the scope here, but know it exists. CERN Internal Tax: Just like in Switzerland, CERN will deduct internal tax from your salary before paying you. You'll get the yearly certificate of internal tax paid, which you use for your French declaration. The certificate essentially keeps both France and Spain off your back regarding income taxes on that money. 💡 Example Scenario (France): Laura, a Spanish researcher, is hired as a CERN fellow based in Prévessin (France). She lives in nearby St-Genis-Pouilly. Here's how her situation unfolds: Convenio and consular registration: She signs up for the convenio especial with Spanish TGSS to continue her Spanish pension contributions while at CERN. She registers with the Spanish Consulate in Lyon (which covers her region). Health coverage: In France, she doesn't enroll in the French sécurité sociale . Instead, she uses the CERN health insurance for herself and her child. When the child needs to see a French pediatrician, she pays the fee and submits a claim to CERN's insurer for reimbursement. She informs the French CPAM that she is covered by an international scheme (if ever asked). Tax filing in France: Laura creates an account on impots.gouv.fr to file her taxes (she'll need to get a French tax number via that process). In her first French tax return, she declares zero taxable employment income, ticks the relevant boxes for exempt CERN income, and attaches her CERN tax attestation. She also declares the small rental income she still receives from renting out her flat in Spain – that part is taxable in Spain (she pays Spanish non-resident tax on it) but under the France-Spain tax treaty, Spain gets to tax the rent and France will not tax it again (she still reports it in France, possibly with a tax credit of equal amount to avoid double taxation). Essentially, her French tax liability remains low; she ends up owing only a token amount for some interest income. Daily life and taxes: Laura pays her French housing tax and notices her utility bills include TV license fees – normal life as a resident. But her CERN salary itself remains fully untouched by French taxation. After CERN – Unemployment: When her contract ends after 3 years, Laura decides to remain in France to look for jobs. Because she didn't contribute to French unemployment insurance, she is not eligible for the standard French unemployment benefit ( Allocation d'aide au retour à l'emploi ). Nor can she get Spanish \"paro\" unless she returns to Spain and meets the contribution requirements there. She can, however, register with Pôle Emploi (the French job center) as a jobseeker. They might offer her career services but no insurance payouts. If she remains unemployed long-term in France with limited resources, she might eventually apply for RSA ( revenu de solidarité active , a welfare benefit) – but that's a last resort. Typically, she plans to find a new job quickly, possibly at another research institute in France, after which she'll start contributing to French social security normally. Returning to Spain: Unemployment and Pension Implications Whether you spend a couple of years at CERN or a full career, at some point you may return to Spain. It's crucial to understand how your CERN tenure will be recognized (or not) by Spanish systems: Unemployment Benefits (\"el paro\") Time worked at CERN does not count for Spanish unemployment insurance ( prestación por desempleo ). Spanish unemployment benefits require that you have contributed to the Spanish unemployment fund (part of social security) through salaried work in Spain or through EU/Bilateral-agreement countries that transfer the credits. CERN is outside these mechanisms – it has no unemployment contributions and is not covered by EU social security coordination. This means: If you quit a job in Spain to go to CERN, you generally have no right to claim Spanish unemployment when leaving for CERN (also because you left work voluntarily). If you finish your CERN contract and return to Spain without a job, you cannot claim unemployment benefit based on your CERN work, since no contributions were made to Spain for that period. If you had accumulated unemployment credits before (for example, you worked in Spain for several years, then left for CERN without ever claiming unemployment), note that those credits remain usable for a period (Spain uses a 6-year look-back for unemployment). After a long stay abroad, some of those contributions may fall outside the look-back window and effectively expire for benefit purposes. Example: Juan had 3 years of contributions in Spain, but he didn't need unemployment and went to CERN for 5 years. When he comes back, those contributions are now 5–8 years old. To qualify for paro , he needs at least 360 days of contributions in the last 6 years. His old contributions are at the edge of 6 years; if he doesn't find a Spanish job immediately, they will slip past 6 years and he won't qualify until he works again for at least a year in Spain. Plan ahead: If you expect to return to Spain, be prepared that you might not have an unemployment safety net. It's wise to save money from your CERN salary to cover a job search period. Alternatively, some choose to transfer to another EU job after CERN, in which case they might consolidate their social security elsewhere before coming back to Spain. (Since France and Switzerland won't have unemployment coverage for you, this mostly matters if you move to another country's system after CERN.) Retirement/Pension Recognition CERN Pension: If you worked at CERN long enough to vest in the CERN Pension Fund (CERN's rules determine the vesting period; fellows sometimes have shorter terms that pay a leaving indemnity rather than a pension, whereas staff with longer service get a pension), CERN's pension is separate from any state system. If you are entitled to a CERN pension, it will be paid out by CERN, and Spain will tax that pension normally ( important note: while salaries were exempt, national taxes can apply to pensions from international organizations – the CERN protocol allows states to tax pensions of former officials. For instance, if you retire in Spain and receive a CERN pension, Spain will treat it as income and tax it under IRPF, unless future law changes). Keep documentation of your CERN contributions and pension rights for when you navigate this later. Spanish State Pension: If you maintained or later accrued sufficient Spanish contributions (15 years minimum, with at least 2 years in the last 15 before retirement, under current rules), you can get a Spanish public pension. The years you paid the convenio especial count as if you were working in Spain for pension purposes. If you did not pay the convenio, those years at CERN are simply blank in your Spanish record. They cannot be filled by \"buying back\" later (Spain generally doesn't allow retroactive contributions except through the convenio at the time or in certain very limited cases). So, your Spanish pension will be calculated based on the contribution years you do have. Spain will not give you any credit for CERN years – except if you contributed in another country's public system in the meantime, which isn't the case here. Totalization with other countries: If you worked in France outside CERN, or in another EU country's system, those periods can be summed with your Spanish periods under EU regulations to determine eligibility and pro-rata pensions. But CERN time cannot be included in those totalizations as it's not part of any national system. Using convenio years in pension: Convenio especial contributions are treated like General Regime contributions for pension calculations. So if you contributed at the minimum base, your eventual pension from Spain will reflect those base amounts for those years (they will likely slightly lower your average base if your other years were at higher salaries, but it ensures you meet thresholds and have continuous coverage). If you only worked at CERN and never contributed in Spain before, signing a convenio would at least start building some Spanish pension rights (though if you end up not reaching 15 years total, you wouldn't get a Spanish pension – in that case, one might rely entirely on the CERN pension or consider moving to another country's system). Not reaching 15 years: If you don't accumulate enough Spanish contribution years and thus don't qualify for a Spanish pension, the contributions you paid (or that your employers paid on your behalf) are not refunded – instead, they might help you qualify for a pension in another country via totalization. But with CERN not being totalizable, you want to make sure you hit the 15 in Spain or plan to totalize with another country. For example, if you had 10 years in Spain and 5 in Germany (after CERN), those would combine to 15 to let you get two partial pensions from each country. CERN years would be ignored in that calculation, except for the separate CERN benefit. Retirement age and special cases: Note that CERN's pension scheme has its own retirement age rules (often around 65). The Spanish system is currently around 66–67 (depending on birth year). You might end up drawing your CERN pension at a different time than your Spanish pension. This is okay – just coordinate with your financial planning. Healthcare in retirement: If you retire in Spain with a Spanish state pension, you regain full access to Spanish public healthcare (and your family) like any pensioner. If you only have a CERN pension and no Spanish pension, you might not automatically have Spanish public healthcare upon return as a resident (because that is tied to being a pensioner of Spain or contributing). However, Spain does have provisions for returning emigrants to access healthcare. For example, there's a possibility to sign a health assistance convenio or prove low income to get into the public system. This goes beyond this guide, but be aware to plan health coverage if you retire in Spain on a foreign pension only. (One strategy: if you contributed some years in Spain, you might at least qualify for a very small Spanish pension or a non-contributory pension, which then grants health coverage.) Summing up: Time at CERN is valuable career experience, but on paper it's \"invisible\" to Spanish Social Security. To the Spanish system, you essentially left the workforce unless you proactively keep a tie (the convenio). So on return, focus on updating your situation: Register again with Seguridad Social when you take up employment, so you start contributing and accruing benefits once more. If you signed a convenio, you can choose to terminate it once you are employed in Spain again (to avoid double paying). Notify TGSS to cancel the convenio when you go back on payroll. For unemployment, after you have worked at least 360 days in Spain post-CERN, you'd regain eligibility for benefits should you need them. Until then, you won't have paro . If you don't immediately find work in Spain, check if you qualify for any subsidies for returnees. Spain sometimes has assistance for returning emigrants (e.g. a one-time subsidy or inclusion in certain training programs). Contacting SEPE or the Consejería de Trabajo at the embassy upon return could provide leads. Key Resources &amp; Forms (Links) Spanish Social Security – Convenio Especial (Emigrants): Official information on convenios especiales is available on the Seguridad Social website. The Convenio Especial para emigrantes españoles e hijos de emigrantes is governed by Real Decreto 996/1986 and Orden TAS/2865/2003. The Spanish Ministry provides a summary PDF with requirements and steps. Form TA.0040 is the application form (available via the Seguridad Social electronic office). You can apply online with Import@ss if you have a digital certificate, or through the provincial TGSS (many expats mail it to TGSS Madrid per the instructions). CERN Admin e-Guide (Taxation in Host States): CERN provides internal guidance for tax declarations in both Switzerland and France. The \"Income Tax Declaration in Switzerland\" guide explains why CERN salaries are exempt and what (if anything) needs doing in Switzerland. The \"Income Tax Declaration in France\" guide gives step-by-step instructions for filling out French tax forms as a CERN staff member. These can be found on CERN's internal websites or obtained from HR. Protocol on Privileges and Immunities (2004): This international treaty underpins your exemptions. Article 10(b) confirms salaries paid by CERN are exempt from national income tax (with internal tax paid to CERN instead). Article 11 exempts CERN staff from national social security contributions, given CERN's own coverage. Spain's BOE published the ratification ( BOE-A-2007-15391 ). While you don't need to read it daily, it's the legal basis you can cite if ever needed with authorities. Spanish Tax Agency (Agencia Tributaria): If you need to declare a change of residence, use Modelo 030 from Agencia Tributaria. Also, when you eventually draw a CERN pension in Spain, consult Agencia Tributaria's guidance on foreign pensions (they will be taxable as IRPF). For now, as long as you're non-resident or your CERN income is exempt, you might not deal with AEAT much – but it's good to be aware of their portal. SEPE (Employment Office) &amp; Returnee info: If you come back to Spain jobless, check SEPE's portal for any \"empleados retornados\" programs. Also, the Ministry of Inclusion's Portal de Retorno may have information for returning emigrants, including healthcare access and any available support. CERN HR and Users Office: Do not hesitate to use CERN's own administrative resources. The Users Office FAQ on Health Insurance and Social Security clarifies many practical points (like Swiss health insurance exemptions, the need for A1 certificates for those who are visitors from EU institutes, etc.). While some of that info is targeted at \"users\" (scientists visiting CERN while employed elsewhere), it's still useful. CERN's HR department can assist in obtaining any attestations you need for Spanish authorities (proof of employment, etc.).

It is not mandatory for short stays, but if you plan to live long-term in Switzerland or France, registration is recommended. The process is carried out at the Consulate General of Spain in Geneva by presenting a DNI or passport and local residence certificate. Spanish legislation states that consular registration is mandatory for those establishing habitual residence outside Spain. Residence Registration in France/Switzerland France has no equivalent to Spain's residence registration; registering at the town hall is not mandatory but can help access local services. In contrast, in Switzerland, all foreigners must register with their local commune within strict deadlines. In the Canton of Geneva, arrival must be declared at the Cantonal Population Office (OCPM) within 14 days if staying more than 3 months. EU citizens must also notify local authorities after 3 months in any Schengen country by requesting a \"registration certificate\" at the town hall. France: No legal obligation to register, but doing so may help access municipal services. Switzerland (Geneva Canton): Mandatory registration at the municipal office (OCPM) within 14 days if staying over 3 months. Residence and Work Permits At CERN, employees receive the Swiss Carte de légitimation , issued by CERN and the Swiss DFAE, which serves as a residence permit in Switzerland and allows Schengen travel without a visa. Requirements include having a work contract (>50% time) and an official residence. The carte is extended to direct family members (spouse/partner and children living with the holder). Non-Swiss family members living in France do not automatically receive this card; they must instead apply for a regular Swiss permit if they want to work in Switzerland. As EU citizens, Spaniards living in France can work freely in the EU with their French residence permit. If they work in Geneva, they typically obtain a \"G permit\" for cross-border workers. In short: if you live in Switzerland with a CERN contract, apply for the Carte de légitimation and Swiss residence permit. If you live in France, you need a French residence permit and the G permit to cross into Switzerland (for you and your family). European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) Before leaving Spain, it's advisable to apply for the EHIC through Social Security (online or at CAISS). The card is sent to the registered Spanish address and allows access to urgent medical care at low or no cost in EU/EEA countries and Switzerland during temporary stays. However, the EHIC does not replace CERN's CHIS health insurance, which provides comprehensive medical coverage in Switzerland and France. In practice, CHIS is your main coverage in the region, while the EHIC is useful for emergencies during travel or before CHIS is activated. Special Agreement with Spanish Social Security The special agreement allows Spanish emigrants to continue contributing voluntarily to Spanish Social Security while working abroad. It helps preserve pension and disability rights in Spain. It can be requested at TGSS (online or in-person) by submitting form TA-0040, DNI, consular certificate, and proof of employment abroad (e.g., residence permit). The minimum contribution in 2024 is about €865 per quarter. The agreement covers retirement, permanent disability, and death/survivor benefits. It is recommended to process this before leaving Spain. Foreign Asset Declaration (Form 720) Spanish tax residents must submit Form 720 if they hold, as of December 31, foreign assets (bank accounts, securities, real estate, etc.) exceeding €50,000 in total. The declaration is informative only (no payment due) and must be submitted between March 1–31 of the following year. If you work at CERN but are still a Spanish tax resident, check if your balances in Swiss or French accounts or properties exceed this threshold. If not, you are not required to declare them, but you must still report your global income in the Spanish tax return. Tax Return Upon Returning to Spain The Spanish income tax law considers the full calendar year to determine tax residence. This means if you return to Spain between January and June, you will be considered a resident from January 1 and must declare your global income for that year. If you return after July 1, your tax residence will begin the following year. In other words, there is no pro-rata: you either declare the full year as a resident or only Spanish income if you were not a tax resident that year. Work and Life at CERN Types of Contracts and Status At CERN, there are mainly two categories of personnel: Staff (permanent employees) and Fellows (temporary contract researchers or scholars). Both are salaried employees and receive similar benefits (salary, CERN social security, CHIS, pensions, etc.). Staff hold permanent or temporary posts (usually renewable fixed-term contracts up to 8 years or indefinite) and may be promoted internally. Fellows are graduates employed for fixed terms (e.g., 2–3 years) for research projects. Both categories contribute to CERN's health and pension schemes. Meanwhile, associates (users, visiting scientists, interns) have short-term agreements and receive a subsistence allowance instead of a salary. In short: Staff/Fellows = salaried employees; Users/Associates = visiting scientists or students with temporary arrangements. Medical Insurance (CHIS) and Reimbursements The CHIS (CERN Health Insurance Scheme) covers all principal personnel (Staff, Fellows, and associates). It reimburses most reasonable medical expenses (consultations, hospital stays, medication, etc.) up to certain limits as per CHIS rules. To claim, you must submit form CHIS/F01 along with original paid invoices, medical prescriptions, and proof of payment. It's essential to keep all receipts and invoices, as CHIS reimburses only paid expenses with documentation. Normally, CHIS covers a high percentage (e.g., 80%) of costs based on rates, and 100% in cases of work-related accidents or occupational illnesses. Holidays and Leave CERN employees (staff or fellows) are entitled to 2.5 working days of vacation per month worked (around 30 days per year). Leave must be requested with prior authorization from a supervisor. It is paid at 100% (no salary or CHIS deductions). However, unpaid special leave (e.g., over 1 month) suspends mandatory CHIS affiliation, so it is advisable to arrange alternative medical coverage during such leave periods. Sick Leave and Accidents In case of illness, CERN regulations provide 100% salary for the first 365 days of leave and then 66.7% for up to 548 additional days. This is more generous than Spanish Social Security (which pays 60–75% after day 3). For occupational illnesses or work accidents, 100% salary is paid indefinitely. A medical certificate must be submitted upon return, as after the 8th day without justification, the absence is deducted from medical leave. In non-work-related accidents, in addition to CHIS reimbursement, there is a specific CHIS/F02 form. CHIS also covers emergencies, maternity, specialists, etc., according to current regulations. CERN Pension Plan Both Staff and Fellows must contribute to the CERN Pension Fund. Current rates (for those hired after 2012) are 12.64% of the salary paid by the employee and 18.96% by CERN. After a minimum of 5 years of service, you may be eligible for a retirement pension. The pension is calculated at 1.85% of the average of the last 36 months of salary per year of contribution (maximum ~70% of salary after ~37 years). Early retirement or termination indemnity options exist, but in practice, the plan ensures significant pension benefits after many years of service. Finance and Banks Opening a Bank Account in Switzerland or France In Switzerland, traditional banks (UBS, Credit Suisse, cantonal banks) usually require Swiss residency and charge high fees. Many expats therefore prefer digital banks: for example, N26 or Revolut allow online accounts in EUR/CHF without living in Switzerland. Some Swiss cantonal banks offer multi-currency accounts for expats, but usually require a Swiss salary and an opening deposit. In France, traditional banks (BNP, Société Générale, etc.) often ask for proof of residence, although online alternatives (Boursorama, ING, Wise) have fewer requirements. Overall, digital banks and neobanks (N26, Revolut, Wise) are convenient for international workers in the area. Transfers and Currency Exchange Traditional transfers and currency exchanges through banks usually involve hidden fees. Services like Wise and Revolut offer much lower costs. Wise always applies the real interbank exchange rate, charging only a small, transparent fee (~0.4%). Revolut is very convenient, although its free plans charge a fee (e.g., 1% on amounts above €1000/month on weekdays). Both allow managing multiple currencies and offer international cards. In short, for EUR/CHF payments or regular remittances, it's advisable to use Wise or Revolut instead of a conventional bank. Declaration of Foreign Assets If you are still considered a Spanish tax resident, you must declare in your tax return any income earned abroad. In addition, balances in foreign bank accounts or assets exceeding €50,000 must be reported using Form 720. This includes Swiss or French bank accounts, investments, or properties outside Spain. If you cease to be a Spanish tax resident (e.g., living abroad >183 days), this obligation ends until you return. Wills and International Inheritance It is advisable to draft wills according to the law of each country where you own property. In Spain, succession is processed by a notary through a deed of inheritance acceptance. In Switzerland, there are statutory shares for spouses and children, and succession is handled by local authorities. If you die in Switzerland leaving assets in Spain, your heirs must present the Swiss certificate of inheritance to a Spanish notary, translated and apostilled. In practice, it is wise to consult a succession lawyer familiar with both jurisdictions. Also, tax obligations must be met: heirs residing in Spain must pay Spanish inheritance tax (form 650) based on the Spanish value, applying credits for taxes paid in Switzerland. Housing and Daily Life Where to Live: Switzerland vs. France Living in Switzerland (close to CERN) means higher salaries and excellent services, but also very high living costs (housing, food, etc.). In France (Pays de Gex, Annemasse), rents and prices are much lower, while public services (education, health) remain good. Many employees choose to live in France to benefit from cheaper housing and supermarkets (e.g., Leclerc, Lidl FR), in exchange for a longer commute to CERN. In Switzerland, quality of life is excellent and the language barrier is low (Geneva is French-speaking), but living space tends to be small and expensive. There is no one-size-fits-all answer: evaluate costs, transport, and family needs to choose between living in Meyrin (CH) or Pays de Gex (FR). Finding Accommodation In Switzerland, housing portals such as homegate.ch , immoscout24.ch , comparis.ch , or anibis.ch are commonly used. It's useful to prepare a dossier with a work contract, recent payslips, proof of residence, and references. In Switzerland, a deposit of 1–3 months is typically required. On the French side, portals like seloger.com , leboncoin.fr , or local agencies are used. French landlords may ask for Spanish payslips and proof of residence. Caution: check contracts carefully, as Swiss leases often include mandatory contents and liability insurance. Rental Contracts and Services In Switzerland, rental contracts are usually signed at the commune or notary office, and a security deposit (usually 2–3 months' rent) is required. It's common to have contents insurance (for furniture) and liability insurance (often required by landlords). In France, after signing the lease, you must register at the local town hall (for taxes and services). In Switzerland, basic services (electricity, gas, water, internet) must be arranged; for example, electricity in Geneva is contracted with SIG. In France, utilities are contracted with companies such as EDF/GDF/Azureva, and internet with providers like Orange, Free, etc. In both countries, a housing tax (\"impôt d'habitation\" in France) is paid annually. It's advisable to arrange these contracts in advance. Transport to CERN CERN is well-connected. Urban bus lines (e.g., TPG 66, F, 61, 65) connect Geneva with CERN and Pays de Gex. Tram line 18 will soon connect central Geneva to Meyrin. CERN also operates internal shuttle buses (e.g., from the airport to various CERN sites). Cross-border workers usually obtain the G permit to drive from France to Switzerland without changing tax residency. There are public parking areas and designated spots for people with disabilities on campus. There is no private \"parking badge\"; general parking follows local signage. Cyclists have access to bike racks at almost all CERN buildings. Tip: request CERN's free multi-transport card to use internal buses, and ask your municipality about cross-border transport subsidies. Shopping and Supermarkets The cost of living in Switzerland is high. Many residents near CERN shop in France: supermarkets in Ferney (Leclerc, Lidl) or Carrefour (Annemasse) are often cheaper than their Swiss counterparts. In Switzerland, budget chains like Denner, ALDI, or Lidl (Swiss version) are recommended. Local fresh produce markets (e.g., Meyrin market on Saturdays) and factory outlet stores are also worth exploring. For personal mail delivery, CERN does not manage private parcels; many use private P.O. boxes at Swiss or French post offices. CERN's official postal service only handles institutional mail. Healthcare in France If you live in France, register your family with the French Sécurité Sociale and choose a general practitioner (\"médecin traitant\") for each member. This is necessary to obtain public health reimbursements. Children can be treated in public or private pediatric clinics; the local Regional Health Agency (ARS) can recommend pediatricians. Spanish associations or consulates may provide lists of bilingual doctors. Note that CERN's CHIS covers your medical expenses in Switzerland/France under its rules; for standard care in France, it's best to register with French social security and obtain the local \"Carte Vitale\" to access government reimbursement. Family and Partner Dependent Spouse or Partner The spouse or registered partner of a CERN contract holder can be registered as a \"family member\" in CHIS if living with the holder. In that case, they are granted a Swiss carte de légitimation similar to the main employee. The family status must be declared in the EDH system and CHIS (using form SHIPID). If the partner lives in France, they do not receive the Swiss carte; instead, they must apply for the appropriate French residence permit (e.g., \"carte de séjour de membre de famille de ressortissant UE\" for non-EU relatives of an EU citizen). EU citizens (like Spaniards) do not need a visa to live in France but must register at the local town hall. Non-EU partners will need the relevant French visa and residence permit. Schooling for Children Children can attend public schools for free in both Switzerland and France. In Geneva, compulsory schooling (primary + lower secondary, about 9 years) is in French, and each commune has public schools. In France, public schools are also free and follow the French calendar. There are also nearby international/bilingual schools (e.g., École Lucie Aubrac in Versoix, Collège international de Ferney-Voltaire). For Spanish-language education, the Education Office in Bern offers after-school Spanish Language and Culture courses (AFLS). CERN offers educational support: there is a nursery/school allowance (Education Fees Allowance) that reimburses part of school costs in Switzerland, and the CERN School Fees that cover fees based on internal regulations. Nurseries, Bilingual Schools, and CERN Support CERN has its own kindergarten (\"Le Jardin des Particules\") for staff children aged 4 months to 6 years. Additionally, there are 60 reserved places in nearby public nurseries (Meyrin and St-Genis-Pouilly) for children aged 3 months to 4 years, so early registration is advised. As for bilingual schools, France offers public institutions with international sections and there are French or Swiss boarding schools (e.g., École Européenne, Institut Florimont) for instruction in English/French. CERN pays family allowances for each child and an additional parental allowance for children under 3. It also covers part of nursery/school fees with the Education Fees Allowance, subject to rules. It's recommended to consult CERN's Social Affairs office for details on child and education support. Parental and Maternity/Paternity Leave CERN offers generous maternity and paternity leave. Maternity leave is at least 16 weeks (100% paid), with more time in case of multiple births or complications. Paternity leave is 10 days (100% paid). For adoption, 15 weeks are granted. After mandatory leave, parents may request unpaid parental leave of up to 4 months while retaining benefits such as CHIS. During pregnancy, employees have the right to prenatal exams with full pay and leave. All leave is managed through CERN's Social Affairs office; notify them in advance to plan your leave. Effect on Legal Status of the Partner Working at CERN can change your partner's migration status. If they live with you in Switzerland, they'll need the appropriate Swiss permit (or the carte de légitimation if cohabiting). If living in France, a Spanish partner does not need a visa but must register at the town hall and obtain the appropriate residence card. To work in Switzerland, an EU partner may need a special \"Ci permit\" for spouses of international organization members. A non-EU partner will need a work permit (usually L or B) in Switzerland. In France, Spanish partners can work freely; non-EU partners will need a \"carte de séjour vie privée et familiale\" or similar. In summary, consult local migration authorities to coordinate permits. CERN provides support for obtaining the carte de légitimation and guidance on these procedures. Community and Useful Resources Spanish Associations In Geneva and the surrounding area, there are several Spanish and Latin American associations that organize cultural events and mutual support networks. There are also active WhatsApp/Telegram groups of Spaniards at CERN (e.g., \"Expats CERN\"). The Swiss Association of Spaniards (CASW) holds talks and cultural events. The CERN Staff Association and employee clubs usually inform newcomers about gatherings or activities with fellow nationals. Joining sports or social clubs at CERN (sports, languages, art, etc.) is another great way to integrate and network. Welcome Sessions for New Members CERN has a welcome program for new employees and associates. Each month, a \"Welcome Session\" is held covering practical information (insurance, payroll, IT security, internal rules). Additionally, broader onboarding sessions are held quarterly to explain how the lab works, staff categories, IT systems, and CERN clubs. These sessions typically include breakfast or networking and are mandatory for new arrivals. They are hosted on Indico and usually coordinated by the Users Office or DAO (Departmental Administrative Officer). Recordings are available if you cannot attend. Internal Events, Clubs, and Activities The CERN Staff Association organizes around 100 clubs (sports, music, languages, photography, etc.) open to staff and their families. Examples include: Cycling Club, CERN Band, football team, piano lessons, foreign languages, etc. Each club runs its own meetings and internal or external competitions. Large events are also held: the year-end Braderie (internal holiday market), Employee Week, concerts, exhibitions, etc. Check the Staff Association's website and CERN bulletin boards for calendars and upcoming events. Getting Help Internally (Incidents, ServiceNow) For technical or administrative issues at CERN, use the ServiceNow platform. For IT or connectivity problems, open an \"IT Incident\" in ServiceNow. For HR, payroll, or leave queries, use \"HR Case\" in ServiceNow. For facility issues or campus emergencies, call internal number 74444 (CERN Emergencies). For more info, visit CERN's Service Portal or ask your DAO/local admin. Glossary of Terms Grade: Professional level in CERN's pay scale (categories A, B, C, D, etc.) determining base salary.

Please consult a qualified advisor for your specific situation. Tax Residency in Spain and the Worldwide Income Principle In general, a person who is a tax resident in Spain must pay IRPF on their total worldwide income , regardless of where it is earned or who pays it. This means that, without special provisions, a salary paid from abroad (e.g., by a company in Switzerland or France) would be subject to Spanish IRPF just like a salary paid by a Spanish company. Spain has signed treaties to avoid double taxation with countries such as Switzerland and France, which establish rules to avoid taxing the same income twice. However, in the case of CERN, special international agreements override this general rule . CERN as an International Organization and its Host Agreement CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) is an international organization based in Geneva, created by international convention. As such, it enjoys privileges and immunities to ensure its functioning. Its special legal status is covered by the Host Agreement and the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of CERN (signed in Geneva on 18 March 2004), ratified by Spain (BOE No. 194, 14/08/2007). This Protocol extends to all Member States (including Spain) the privileges already granted by the host countries (Switzerland since 1955 and France since 1965). Among these privileges is the tax exemption on salaries paid to CERN personnel . Specifically, the Protocol provides that CERN and its officials are exempt from national direct taxes in the exercise of their official duties . IRPF Exemption on CERN Salaries Under the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities, salaries and emoluments paid by CERN to its staff are exempt from national income tax in Member States . That is, Spain does not tax CERN salaries under IRPF . Instead, employees pay an internal tax to CERN itself, based on a system established by the organization's Council. This tax exemption has explicit legal grounds: staff shall be subject to a tax, for the benefit of the Organization, on salaries and emoluments paid by it. Such salaries and emoluments shall be exempt from national income tax . In other words, CERN salaries are not taxable in Spain , just as is the case for officials of other international organizations (such as the EU or UN) with similar immunity systems. This exemption does not depend on the physical time spent in Switzerland or France; it applies because the income originates from a tax-exempt international organization. In fact, in the host countries themselves, CERN personnel are also exempt from local taxes on these salaries. As a CERN Member State, Spain recognizes this exemption on its territory. The employee does not need to pay tax in Spain on CERN salaries as they would for a Spanish company salary, provided the income is effectively subject to CERN's internal tax (which is certified by an annual CERN internal tax certificate). CERN's official guidance reaffirms that, following the implementation of its internal tax system (approved by all Member States), remunerations paid by CERN should be exempt from national income tax . In practice, Spanish employees must declare their situation to the Spanish Tax Agency and attach the CERN certificate to justify the exemption under the international agreement, similar to practices in other countries (e.g., in France, CERN salaries are omitted from the salary field and an explanatory note about the treaty exemption is added). Applicable Spanish Law and Bilateral Agreements The exemption for CERN salaries in Spain is based on international law incorporated into Spanish domestic law (Art. 96 of the Spanish Constitution). The Spanish Ratification Instrument of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of CERN (2004), published in the BOE, is the main reference. Additionally, the IRPF Law respects these agreements: for instance, Article 2 of Law 35/2006 states that IRPF provisions apply without prejudice to the provisions of international treaties or agreements signed by Spain. Thus, the general obligation to tax worldwide income (Art. 2 LIRPF) gives way to the exemption established in the international agreement . The bilateral double taxation agreements between Spain and Switzerland (Convention of 26/04/1966, revised by the protocol of 29/06/2006) and between Spain and France (Convention of 10/10/1995) are also part of the legal framework. However, in this specific case, no double taxation occurs because neither Switzerland nor France tax these salaries (due to CERN's immunity), and Spain cannot tax them under the cited Protocol. Therefore, those bilateral agreements are not applicable to CERN salaries, as they are exempt ab initio in all involved countries. In summary : an employee directly hired by CERN and fiscally resident in Spain does not pay Spanish tax on CERN income in the same way they would on a Spanish company salary. This is due to tax exemptions established in the relevant international agreements. The CERN Host Agreement/Privileges Protocol accepted by Spain exempts CERN salaries from Spanish IRPF (while still subject to CERN's internal tax). Spanish regulations and treaties align with this exemption, giving priority to the international stipulations . Therefore, CERN salaries are exempt from taxation in Spain , while fulfilling the required declaration formalities and CERN's internal tax obligations — thereby ensuring no effective double taxation .

Installing and Setting up WSL and SSH on Windows On Windows 10/11 you can enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) by running the wsl --install command in an elevated PowerShell:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. This will install the default Linux distro (usually Ubuntu) and set it up. Once WSL is installed and restarted, open the Linux shell (Ubuntu). You should have an SSH client available (Ubuntu typically includes openssh-client by default). If it's not present, install it with sudo apt update && sudo apt install openssh-client . (Windows itself also offers an OpenSSH client feature, but using WSL's SSH ensures you use the same Linux-style configuration and key files as your other Linux tools:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.) Optional tip: It's recommended to use WSL 2 (which has a full Linux kernel) for better compatibility. You can check your WSL version with wsl -l -v and upgrade if needed:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. 2. Installing and Configuring VS Code and Remote-SSH Install Visual Studio Code on Windows if you haven't already:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. During installation, choose the \"Add to PATH\" option so you can launch it from the terminal with code . :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. Once VS Code is installed, open it and install the Remote - SSH extension from the Extensions Marketplace:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. (If you plan to open VS Code from within WSL, you may also install the \"Remote - WSL\" extension:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}, but the key steps below assume you use the Remote-SSH extension.) After installing Remote-SSH, configure it to use your SSH client. By default it will use your system's ssh . You can leave this as is (it will use WSL's ssh when VS Code is launched from WSL). If VS Code does not pick up WSL's ssh , you can create a wrapper script (e.g. ssh.bat ) that calls wsl.exe ssh %* and set the VS Code setting remote.SSH.path to that batch file:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. This ensures VS Code uses the same SSH configuration and keys as your WSL environment. OpenSSH client: Ensure a compatible OpenSSH client is installed:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. On Windows this is usually present by default or can be enabled in Optional Features. In WSL (Ubuntu), the ssh command is typically already available. VS Code: Install VS Code (with \"Add to PATH\"):contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. Extensions: In VS Code's Extensions, install \"Remote - SSH\":contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} (and optionally \"Remote - WSL\" if using WSL natively). Initial setup: After installation, press F1 (or Ctrl+Shift+P) and select \"Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...\" to start configuring a new SSH host:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. 3. Setting up SSH Keys in WSL It's strongly recommended to use SSH key-based authentication for remote hosts:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. In your WSL shell, generate a new SSH key pair if you don't have one: for example, ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa , and follow the prompts (you can leave the passphrase empty for passwordless login, or set one for more security). This creates ~/.ssh/id_rsa (private key) and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (public key). Next, copy your public key to lxplus: one way is ssh-copy-id username@lxplus.cern.ch , which logs into lxplus and installs your key. If ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually append the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on lxplus (after logging in once with your password). This allows you to authenticate without a password. Tip: Make sure your private key file is secure: chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa and chmod 700 ~/.ssh . SSH will refuse to use keys that are accessible by others:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. You can also add your key to the ssh-agent in WSL ( eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\" && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa ) so you don't have to enter a passphrase repeatedly. Once keys are in place, test in WSL: ssh username@lxplus.cern.ch should log you in without a password. This confirms the key setup. 4. Configuring SSH Access to lxplus Edit your WSL SSH config file ~/.ssh/config (create it if it doesn't exist) and add an entry for lxplus. For example: Host lxplus HostName lxplus.cern.ch User yourusername IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa Replace yourusername with your CERN account name. With this config, you can simply run ssh lxplus instead of the full host name. VS Code will also use this entry when you connect. Proxying and additional hosts: If you need to connect to other machines inside CERN's network via lxplus, you can add more entries. For example, to reach somehost.cern.ch behind lxplus: Host somehost HostName somehost.cern.ch User yourusername ProxyJump lxplus This uses lxplus as a jump host. Now ssh somehost will tunnel through lxplus. This is similar to the example in CERN's documentation:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}. Load balancing tip: lxplus is a cluster front-end, so SSH goes to random nodes. To avoid VS Code's server launching on different nodes, enable SSH multiplexing: under the Host lxplus entry add: ControlMaster auto ControlPath ~/.ssh/sockets/%r@%h-%p ControlPersist 60 This reuses the first connection for all subsequent sessions:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}, ensuring stability. (Create the directory ~/.ssh/sockets first.) 5. Connecting to lxplus Using VS Code With SSH set up, start VS Code (you can launch it from WSL by running code . in a WSL terminal to ensure it uses the Linux environment:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}). In VS Code, open the Command Palette (F1) and choose Remote-SSH: Connect to Host... , then type lxplus (or yourusername@lxplus.cern.ch ) as the host:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. VS Code will use the SSH client to connect. If prompted, accept lxplus's host key and enter your passphrase if you set one. Once connected, VS Code will install its server components on lxplus. You will then have a new (empty) VS Code window connected to lxplus:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}. You can open any remote folder or workspace via File → Open. The VS Code terminal will now run on lxplus, and you can work on files there seamlessly. Extensions on Remote: When first connected, VS Code may ask you to install any needed extensions on lxplus. Ensure your language support extensions (Python, C++, etc.) are enabled in the remote context. 6. Generalizing to Other Remote Servers Connecting to other Linux servers works the same way. For each server, generate or reuse an SSH key, install the public key on the server (e.g. using ssh-copy-id ), and add a corresponding entry in ~/.ssh/config : Host myserver HostName myserver.example.com User remoteuser IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_myserver Then use \"Remote-SSH: Connect to Host\" in VS Code and select myserver . VS Code will SSH into it and open the remote folder. You can also connect to Windows servers (if they run an SSH server) similarly. The process of key-based auth, config entries, and VS Code Remote is the same:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}. If the server uses a nonstandard port, add a Port line in the config or include -p in the connection command. You can chain multiple hops with multiple Host entries and ProxyJump if needed:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. 7. Troubleshooting Common Problems SSH permissions: If you see errors about file permissions on your private key or ~/.ssh directory, fix them (e.g. chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa , chmod 700 ~/.ssh ):contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}. SSH requires strict permissions on keys and configs. Connection hangs or fails: Check the VS Code \"Remote - SSH\" output log (View → Output, select \"Remote - SSH\") for clues. You can also try manually SSHing from WSL (e.g. ssh -v lxplus ) to debug issues. Make sure the host names and user names in your config match exactly. Wrong user or host: In VS Code, ensure you connect using User@Host that matches your ~/.ssh/config (or use the host alias). If VS Code uses the wrong SSH config, set the remote.SSH.configFile to point to WSL's ~/.ssh/config (e.g. \\\\\\\\wsl$\\\\Ubuntu\\\\home\\\\username\\\\.ssh\\\\config ) so it uses the same file. VS Code server errors: If the VS Code Remote server fails to start, try killing it on the remote host: connect via normal SSH and run rm -rf ~/.vscode-server , then reconnect. This forces a clean reinstall. Also ensure your home directory on lxplus has enough space and is not on a slow network file system. Using WSL's ssh in VS Code: If VS Code cannot find ssh or you want it to use WSL's environment, set remote.SSH.path as described above:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}. This ensures VS Code runs the ssh command inside WSL, so it uses your Linux keys and config. Load balancing on lxplus: If VS Code seems to connect then suddenly disconnect (or you have to enter password again), it could be switching nodes. Using ControlMaster (see above) usually fixes this:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}. Also make sure the HostName is lxplus.cern.ch , not a specific node name, unless you know exactly which node. Firewall and network: If you are offsite (outside CERN network), you may need to set up an SSH tunnel or VPN to access lxplus. CERN documentation suggests using SSH tunneling or VPN for off-campus access. Check CERN IT guidelines if you can't reach lxplus from home.

It does not constitute legal, financial, or tax advice. Always consult a qualified advisor for your specific situation. What is Modelo 720? Modelo 720 is an informative declaration (not a tax payment) that Spanish tax residents must file to report assets held outside Spain. It was introduced by Law 7/2012 and developed by Real Decreto 1558/2012. The declaration applies when the total value of assets in any of the three defined categories exceeds 50,000 euros. It is purely informational: filing Modelo 720 does not result in any tax payment by itself, but failure to file can trigger significant penalties. Who Must File? Any individual who is a tax resident of Spain and who holds assets abroad exceeding the thresholds must file Modelo 720. This includes CERN employees who maintain their fiscal residence in Spain. CERN-specific considerations apply: if you live and work in Geneva or Pays de Gex but remain a Spanish tax resident (for example, because your family stays in Spain or your centre of vital interests is there), you are subject to this obligation. Non-residents of Spain do NOT need to file Modelo 720. If you have transferred your tax residence abroad, this declaration does not apply to you. The Three Categories Modelo 720 groups foreign assets into three independent categories, each with its own 50,000 euro threshold: Category 1 - Bank accounts: Current accounts, savings accounts, term deposits, and any other bank accounts held at financial institutions located outside Spain. Category 2 - Securities, insurance, and annuities: Shares, investment funds, life insurance policies, and pension rights held abroad. For CERN employees, the CERN Pension Fund falls under this category. Category 3 - Real estate: Any property (land, buildings, apartments) located outside Spain, including property in France or Switzerland. Each category is evaluated independently. You only need to declare the categories where your total holdings exceed 50,000 euros. For example, if you have 60,000 euros in Swiss bank accounts but only 30,000 euros in French property, you would only declare Category 1. Filing Deadlines &amp; Re-filing Rules The initial Modelo 720 declaration must be filed between 1 January and 31 March of the year following the one in which you first exceeded the 50,000 euro threshold in any category. In subsequent years, you only need to re-file for a given category if the total value of assets in that category has increased by more than 20,000 euros compared to the last declaration you submitted for that category. CERN-Specific Considerations CERN employees who are Spanish tax residents typically have several types of foreign assets that may need to be declared: Swiss bank accounts: If you hold accounts at Swiss or French banks (e.g. UBS, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas) with combined balances exceeding 50,000 euros, these must be declared under Category 1. CERN Pension Fund: Your accumulated rights in the CERN Pension Fund are generally considered to fall under Category 2 (securities, insurance, and annuities). When the accumulated value exceeds 50,000 euros, you should declare it. French or Swiss property: If you own an apartment or house in France or Switzerland, it must be declared under Category 3 when its acquisition value exceeds 50,000 euros. Post-2022 ECJ Ruling In January 2022, the Court of Justice of the European Union (Case C-788/19) ruled that the penalty regime associated with Modelo 720 was disproportionate and contrary to EU law. The court found that the fines and the presumption of unjustified capital gains were excessive. Following the ruling, Spain reformed the penalty system through Law 5/2022. The disproportionate fines were removed, and the regime was aligned with standard tax infraction penalties. However, the obligation to declare foreign assets through Modelo 720 remains fully in force. Modelo 721: Crypto Assets Since 2024, Spanish tax residents must also file Modelo 721 to declare cryptocurrency holdings on foreign exchanges. This new form follows the same logic as Modelo 720, with an independent 50,000 euro threshold for crypto assets held on platforms located outside Spain. Step-by-Step Filing Walkthrough Access the Agencia Tributaria electronic office at sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es . Authenticate using your digital certificate (certificado digital), DNIe, or Cl@ve PIN. Navigate to the Modelo 720 form and fill in the relevant categories with details of your foreign assets, including account numbers, ISIN codes, property references, and balances as of 31 December. Review the declaration carefully and submit it electronically. Save or print the confirmation receipt for your records.

It does not constitute legal, financial, or tax advice. The content is not official and should not be used as a substitute for professional guidance. Please consult a qualified advisor for your specific situation. Before Leaving Geneva (3-6 months before) Notify CERN HR: Inform your supervisor and HR department of your departure date. Confirm end-of-contract formalities, final salary payment, and any leaving indemnity or pension options. Request certificates: Obtain your CERN employment certificate, internal tax certificates for all years worked, and a pension fund statement showing your accumulated rights and options. Baja consular: Visit the Spanish Consulate to process your consular de-registration (baja consular). This formally records your return to Spain and is needed for certain administrative steps back home. Convenio especial: If you have been paying the convenio especial with Spanish Social Security, decide whether to continue it until your return date or terminate it once you are back and re-employed in Spain. Medical records: Collect your complete medical records, prescriptions, and any ongoing treatment documentation from CERN CHIS. Request a coverage end-date certificate from CHIS. Pension fund options: Review your CERN Pension Fund options: deferred pension, lump-sum withdrawal, or transfer. Deadlines for certain elections may apply, so consult the Pension Fund office early. Notify your commune: De-register from your Swiss commune (or French mairie). Return your carte de legitimation and cancel any local insurance, utilities, and subscriptions. Administrative Steps on Arrival in Spain Empadronamiento: Register at your local town hall (ayuntamiento) as soon as you have a residential address in Spain. The padron certificate is essential for healthcare, voting, and other services. Certificado de emigrante retornado: Apply at the Delegacion or Subdelegacion del Gobierno for a returning emigrant certificate. This document can unlock certain benefits and is proof of your time spent abroad. DNI update: Update your DNI with your new Spanish address at a police station (comisaria). If your DNI has expired while abroad, renew it as a priority since it is required for most administrative procedures. Healthcare &amp; Social Security Re-entering the healthcare system: Once empadronado, visit your local Social Security office (INSS or CAISS) to register for public healthcare. If you maintained the convenio especial, you should have continuity of coverage. Otherwise, you may need to register as a resident without resources or wait until you start employment. Convenio especial coverage: If you maintained the convenio especial, your healthcare and pension rights remain active. Present your convenio documentation and padron certificate at the INSS to confirm your status. SEPE path: If you return without employment, register at SEPE (public employment service) as a jobseeker. This is a prerequisite for accessing certain benefits and active employment programmes, even if you do not qualify for unemployment benefits. Employment &amp; Unemployment (SEPE) Register at SEPE: As a returning emigrant, register as a jobseeker (demandante de empleo) at your local SEPE office. Bring your returning emigrant certificate, padron, DNI, and CERN employment certificate. CERN years do NOT count for paro: Time at CERN does not generate Spanish unemployment benefit rights, since no unemployment contributions were paid to Spain. You cannot claim prestacion por desempleo based on CERN employment alone. EU coordination: EU social security coordination regulations do not apply to CERN employment because CERN is outside national social security systems. If you previously had Spanish unemployment contributions within the last six years, check whether those older contributions are still within the look-back window to qualify for benefits. CERN Pension: Options &amp; Spanish Taxation Deferred pension: If you are vested in the CERN Pension Fund (typically after five years of service), you can leave your benefits in the fund and draw a pension when you reach CERN retirement age. The pension will be paid monthly by CERN. Lump sum: You may be eligible to withdraw a lump-sum leaving allowance instead of a deferred pension, depending on your length of service and the fund rules at the time. Consult the Pension Fund office for details and tax implications. Transfer: In certain cases, you may be able to transfer your CERN pension rights to another pension scheme. This option is limited and subject to specific agreements between CERN and the receiving institution. IRPF taxation: Unlike CERN salaries (which are exempt), CERN pensions received by Spanish tax residents are subject to IRPF. Spain considers the CERN pension as rendimientos del trabajo and taxes it under the standard income tax brackets. Plan accordingly, as the net amount will be lower than the gross pension. Financial &amp; Practical Matters Closing bank accounts: Close or restructure your Swiss and French bank accounts as needed. Some people keep a foreign account for pension payments or ongoing obligations. Notify your banks of your change of tax residence. Transferring savings: Use low-cost transfer services (Wise, Revolut) to move savings from CHF or EUR accounts to your Spanish bank. Be aware of large-transfer reporting requirements in Spain (Modelo S-1 for transfers above 10,000 euros). Importing your car: If you bring a vehicle registered abroad into Spain, you must register it with the DGT (Direccion General de Trafico) within 30 days. You may be exempt from import duties if you qualify as a returning resident (under the household goods exemption), but you must apply at customs (Aduana) with proof of your foreign residence. Household goods: Returning emigrants can import personal belongings duty-free if they have lived abroad for at least 12 months. Prepare an inventory and present it at customs along with your returning emigrant certificate and proof of prior residence abroad. Tax Implications of the Return Year Full tax resident: Spain determines tax residence for the full calendar year. If you return before July, you will likely be considered tax resident for the entire year and must declare your worldwide income for that year. Exempt months: CERN salary received during the months you were still a CERN employee remains exempt under the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities. Only non-CERN income and any Spanish employment income after your return are taxable. Modelo 720: If you still hold foreign assets above the 50,000 euro threshold on 31 December of the return year, you must file Modelo 720 in the following year (January-March). This includes Swiss or French bank accounts, CERN pension fund rights, and foreign property. First IRPF declaration: In your first Spanish tax return after returning, declare your worldwide income for the year, applying the CERN salary exemption for the months worked at CERN. Attach the CERN internal tax certificate and any other documentation supporting the exemption.

Close to skiing and outdoor activities in the Jura. Growing community of CERN families. Annemasse: Larger town on the French-Swiss border south of Geneva. Lower rents, connected to Geneva by Leman Express train. Longer commute to CERN. Finding Housing CERN Housing Service: CERN offers a Housing Service that maintains a list of available rentals and can assist newcomers. Check the CERN internal website or contact the Users Office for details. Temporary on-site accommodation (CERN hostel) may be available for your first weeks. Websites: In Switzerland: homegate.ch, immoscout24.ch, comparis.ch. In France: seloger.com, leboncoin.fr, bien-ici.com. Cross-border: CERN Market (internal) and local Facebook groups. Facebook groups: Search for groups like \"CERN Housing\", \"Expats in Geneva\", \"Pays de Gex Expats\". These often have listings and useful advice from other CERN employees. Scam warnings: Be wary of listings that seem too good to be true, request money upfront before viewing, or use suspicious payment methods. Always visit the property in person before signing any contract. Transport TPG: Transports Publics Genevois operates buses and trams in the Geneva area. Lines 66 and 68 serve CERN directly. A monthly pass (Unireso) covers all public transport in the Geneva zone. Unireso: The integrated fare system covering TPG buses/trams, SBB trains, and Mouettes boats in the Greater Geneva area. Monthly passes available for different zones. Leman Express: Regional train connecting Geneva to surrounding French towns (Annemasse, Annecy corridor). Useful if you live south of the border. CERN shuttles: CERN operates internal shuttle buses between its sites (Meyrin and Prevessin campuses). Free for CERN personnel. Cycling: The area is generally flat and cycle-friendly. CERN has bike racks at most buildings. Geneva has a bike-sharing scheme (Donkey Republic/Velospot). Car: Many people living in France commute by car. Parking is available at CERN but can be limited. Cross-border commuters typically need a G permit for Switzerland. Health Insurance CHIS: The CERN Health Insurance Scheme is your primary coverage. It covers medical expenses in Switzerland, France, and abroad. All CERN employees and their registered dependents are enrolled automatically. LAMal: Swiss mandatory health insurance. CERN staff with a carte de legitimation are exempt and do not need LAMal. However, family members without CERN status working in Switzerland may need to enrol. CMU/PUMA: French universal healthcare. CERN employees living in France are generally exempt from compulsory affiliation thanks to CHIS coverage. If your partner works in France outside CERN, they would join the French system. Banking Swiss accounts: Traditional banks (UBS, BCGE) often require Swiss residency and charge significant fees. Useful for receiving salary in CHF and paying Swiss rent. CERN may help with introductions to local banks. French accounts: Banks like BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, or online banks (Boursorama, Fortuneo) are options for those living in France. Needed for French rent payments and direct debits. Multi-currency options: Digital banks like Wise, Revolut, and N26 are popular with CERN employees for low-fee currency exchange between CHF and EUR and international transfers. Groceries &amp; Shopping Swiss supermarkets: Migros and Coop are the main chains. Lidl and Aldi offer lower prices. Shopping in Switzerland is significantly more expensive than in France. French supermarkets: Carrefour, Leclerc, Lidl, and Intermarche in the Pays de Gex area offer much lower prices than Swiss equivalents. Many Swiss residents cross the border to shop in France. CERN cafeterias: CERN has several restaurants and cafeterias on site (Restaurant 1, Restaurant 2, etc.) offering affordable meals. Coffee corners and vending machines are available throughout the campus.

Choose the section that matches your operating system. What is Kerberos and Why CERN Uses It Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that uses tickets to prove identity without sending passwords over the network. CERN operates the CERN.CH Kerberos realm for centralized authentication across its computing infrastructure. When you authenticate with Kerberos, you receive a time-limited ticket-granting ticket (TGT) that lets you access CERN services such as lxplus, AFS, EOS, and GitLab without re-entering your password each time. This ticket-based system is fundamental to working at CERN. Linux Setup Install the Kerberos client tools on Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions: sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install krb5-user Then configure /etc/krb5.conf with the CERN realm settings. Replace the contents of the file (or create it) with: [libdefaults] default_realm = CERN.CH ticket_lifetime = 25h renew_lifetime = 120h forwardable = true proxiable = true [realms] CERN.CH = { kdc = cerndc.cern.ch master_kdc = cerndc.cern.ch default_domain = cern.ch kpasswd_server = afskrb5m.cern.ch admin_server = afskrb5m.cern.ch } [domain_realm] .cern.ch = CERN.CH cern.ch = CERN.CH On Fedora/RHEL, install with sudo dnf install krb5-workstation . The krb5.conf file is the same. macOS Setup macOS ships with a built-in Kerberos implementation (Heimdal). You do not need to install additional packages. Simply create or edit the file /etc/krb5.conf with the same configuration shown in the Linux section above. On modern macOS you may need to use sudo to edit files in /etc/ . Also note that macOS Heimdal may handle ticket renewal slightly differently; if you experience issues, try setting renewable = true in the [libdefaults] section. Windows / WSL Setup On Windows, the recommended approach is to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Inside your WSL distribution (e.g., Ubuntu), install and configure Kerberos exactly as described in the Linux section above. If you also want to use VS Code Remote to connect to lxplus, see the VS Code Remote via WSL guide for complementary setup instructions on SSH through WSL. Getting a Kerberos Ticket Once your configuration is in place, use these commands to manage Kerberos tickets: # Obtain a new ticket (you will be prompted for your CERN password) kinit username@CERN.CH # List current tickets and expiration times klist # Renew an existing ticket (before it expires) kinit -R # Destroy all tickets (log out) kdestroy Replace username with your CERN account name. Tickets are valid for 25 hours by default and renewable for up to 5 days, as specified in the configuration above. SSH Configuration for lxplus To connect to lxplus using your Kerberos ticket (no password needed), add the following to your ~/.ssh/config file: Host lxplus HostName lxplus.cern.ch User yourusername GSSAPIAuthentication yes GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes GSSAPITrustDns yes ForwardAgent yes With this configuration and a valid Kerberos ticket, you can simply run ssh lxplus and you will be authenticated automatically via GSSAPI (Kerberos). Replace yourusername with your CERN login. SSH Tunneling &amp; Off-site Access When working from outside the CERN network, you may need to use lxtunnel.cern.ch as a jump host. Add this to your ~/.ssh/config : Host lxtunnel HostName lxtunnel.cern.ch User yourusername GSSAPIAuthentication yes GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes Host lxplus-tunnel HostName lxplus.cern.ch User yourusername ProxyJump lxtunnel GSSAPIAuthentication yes GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes You can also set up a SOCKS proxy through lxplus for accessing CERN-internal web services from off-site: ssh -D 1080 -N lxplus Then configure your browser to use localhost:1080 as a SOCKS5 proxy to reach internal CERN pages. Keytab for Automated Access For scripts or automated processes that need Kerberos authentication without interactive login, you can create a keytab file: cern-get-keytab --keytab ~/private/keytab --login --user yourusername Then obtain a ticket non-interactively with: kinit -kt ~/private/keytab yourusername@CERN.CH Security warning: A keytab file is equivalent to a stored password. Protect it with strict file permissions ( chmod 600 ) and never share it or commit it to version control. Accessing EOS and AFS With a valid Kerberos ticket, you can access CERN storage systems: EOS (CERN's distributed storage) can be accessed on lxplus with the eos command-line tool: # List your EOS home directory eos ls /eos/user/u/username/ # Copy a file to EOS eos cp localfile.txt /eos/user/u/username/ # Mount EOS via FUSE (if available) mkdir -p ~/eos eosfusebind ~/eos AFS (Andrew File System) requires an AFS token, which you obtain from your Kerberos ticket: # Get an AFS token from your Kerberos ticket aklog # Access your AFS workspace ls /afs/cern.ch/user/u/username/ Troubleshooting kinit: Cannot find KDC for realm CERN.CH &mdash; Your /etc/krb5.conf is missing or misconfigured. Verify the file exists and contains the correct realm settings. kinit: Client not found in Kerberos database &mdash; Check that you are using the correct CERN username and the realm is CERN.CH (uppercase). Permission denied (GSSAPI) &mdash; Run klist to check if your ticket is valid and not expired. Run kinit again if needed. Ticket expired or cannot renew &mdash; If your ticket has been expired for too long, renewal will fail. Run kdestroy followed by kinit to get a fresh ticket. SSH connection refused off-site &mdash; CERN restricts direct SSH access from outside its network. Use the lxtunnel ProxyJump configuration described above. Clock skew too great &mdash; Kerberos requires synchronized clocks. Ensure your system clock is correct (use NTP). A skew of more than 5 minutes will cause authentication failures.

ROOT is an open-source C++ and Python framework developed at CERN for data processing, statistical analysis, visualization, and storage in high-energy physics (HEP). It is the standard tool for analyzing particle physics data and is used by virtually every experiment at CERN. ROOT provides specialized data structures (such as TTree for columnar data), histogramming, curve fitting, and a powerful I/O system based on the .root file format. It also includes CLING, an interactive C++ interpreter, and PyROOT, a Python interface to all ROOT classes. Zero-Install Option: SWAN If you want to start using ROOT immediately without installing anything, CERN provides SWAN (Service for Web-based ANalysis) at swan.cern.ch . SWAN is a JupyterHub-based service that gives you a notebook environment with ROOT, PyROOT, and many other scientific Python packages pre-installed. Simply log in with your CERN credentials, choose a software stack, and start coding. SWAN connects to your EOS storage, so you can access your data files directly. This is the fastest way to get started with ROOT at CERN. Installation Methods Conda (Recommended for personal machines) The easiest way to install ROOT on your personal machine is via conda-forge: conda create -n root-env conda activate root-env conda install -c conda-forge root Snap (Linux) On Linux distributions that support Snap packages: sudo snap install root-framework Homebrew (macOS) On macOS with Homebrew installed: brew install root Pre-built Binaries Download pre-compiled binaries for your platform from the official ROOT website at root.cern/install . Extract the archive and source the setup script: tar -xzf root_v6.XX.YY.Linux-ubuntu22-x86_64-gcc11.4.tar.gz source root/bin/thisroot.sh On lxplus (CVMFS) On CERN's lxplus machines, ROOT is available through CVMFS without any installation. Simply set up the LCG software environment: # List available LCG releases ls /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/ # Set up a specific LCG release (example) source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_105/x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt/setup.sh # Verify ROOT is available root --version First Steps with ROOT Interactive C++ (CLING) Launch ROOT's interactive C++ interpreter by typing root in your terminal: $ root root [0] TH1F *h = new TH1F(\"h\", \"My Histogram\", 100, -5, 5); root [1] h->FillRandom(\"gaus\", 10000); root [2] h->Draw(); root [3] .q PyROOT Use ROOT from Python with the PyROOT bindings: import ROOT # Create and fill a histogram h = ROOT.TH1F(\"h\", \"Gaussian Distribution;x;Entries\", 100, -5, 5) h.FillRandom(\"gaus\", 10000) # Draw on a canvas c = ROOT.TCanvas(\"c\", \"My Canvas\", 800, 600) h.Draw() c.SaveAs(\"histogram.png\") Reading .root Files Open and explore an existing ROOT file: import ROOT f = ROOT.TFile.Open(\"data.root\") f.ls() # List contents tree = f.Get(\"Events\") # Get a TTree tree.Print() # Show branches tree.Draw(\"pt\") # Quick plot of a branch NumPy / pandas Integration Convert ROOT data to NumPy arrays or pandas DataFrames for use with the broader Python ecosystem: import ROOT import numpy as np # Using RDataFrame (modern ROOT approach) df = ROOT.RDataFrame(\"Events\", \"data.root\") npy = df.AsNumpy([\"pt\", \"eta\"]) # Returns dict of NumPy arrays # Convert to pandas DataFrame import pandas as pd pdf = pd.DataFrame(npy) Essential Resources ROOT Reference Documentation ROOT Tutorials (with source code) RDataFrame Documentation SWAN - Service for Web-based ANalysis ROOT User Forum ROOT on GitHub Common First-Week Tasks Open a SWAN session and run a ROOT tutorial notebook to get familiar with the environment. Set up ROOT on lxplus using CVMFS and run root --version to confirm it works. Ask your supervisor or team for a sample .root file from your experiment and practice opening it with TFile and browsing its contents. Try creating a histogram from a TTree branch using both the C++ interpreter and PyROOT. Explore RDataFrame, ROOT's modern analysis interface, for filtering, defining new columns, and creating plots. Install ROOT on your personal laptop (via Conda or Homebrew) so you can develop offline. Bookmark the ROOT forum and reference documentation for when you need help.

This is the primary platform for version control and collaboration on CERN software projects. Unlike public GitHub, CERN GitLab is integrated with CERN Single Sign-On (SSO) and is accessible to anyone with a CERN computing account. While many open-source HEP projects also maintain mirrors on GitHub, the authoritative repositories for experiment frameworks, internal tools, and configuration management typically live on CERN GitLab. Your group or experiment will likely require you to use it for day-to-day development. Authentication Methods CERN GitLab supports several authentication methods: CERN SSO (web): Log in to the GitLab web interface using your CERN credentials. This is automatic if you are already logged into CERN SSO. SSH keys: The preferred method for command-line Git operations. Set up once and use without entering passwords. Kerberos: Clone and push using your Kerberos ticket via the https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/ URL scheme. Personal Access Token (PAT): Generate a token in GitLab settings for HTTPS-based authentication. Useful for scripts and CI/CD integrations. Setting Up SSH Keys for GitLab Generate an SSH key pair if you do not already have one: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your.name@cern.ch\" Copy the public key to your clipboard: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub Then add it to your CERN GitLab account: Go to gitlab.cern.ch/-/user_settings/ssh_keys Paste your public key into the \"Key\" field Give it a descriptive title (e.g., \"Laptop - Ubuntu 2026\") Click \"Add key\" Test the connection: ssh -T git@gitlab.cern.ch Add this to your ~/.ssh/config for convenience: Host gitlab.cern.ch User git IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 PreferredAuthentications publickey Kerberos Authentication for Git If you prefer to use Kerberos instead of SSH keys, you can clone repositories using the Kerberos-authenticated HTTPS endpoint on port 8443: # First, get a Kerberos ticket kinit username@CERN.CH # Clone using the Kerberos URL git clone https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/group/project.git This method is especially convenient on lxplus where you already have a Kerberos ticket. No additional configuration is needed beyond a valid ticket. Basic Git Workflow at CERN Most CERN projects follow a merge-request-based workflow similar to the standard GitLab flow: Fork or branch: Create a personal fork of the project or a feature branch (depending on your project's conventions). Develop locally: Clone the repo, create a branch, make your changes, and commit. Push: Push your branch to your fork or the upstream repository. Open a Merge Request (MR): On the GitLab web interface, create a merge request targeting the main branch. Add a description, assign reviewers. Code review: Respond to feedback, push additional commits if needed. Merge: Once approved, the MR is merged (usually by the maintainer or yourself if you have permissions). # Typical workflow commands git clone git@gitlab.cern.ch:group/project.git cd project git checkout -b my-feature # ... make changes ... git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"Add new feature\" git push origin my-feature # Then open MR on GitLab web UI CI/CD on CERN GitLab CERN GitLab provides built-in CI/CD pipelines powered by GitLab Runners. Many shared runners are available, including runners that can access CVMFS for experiment software. To set up CI/CD for your project, create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the repository root: stages: - build - test build-job: stage: build image: gitlab-registry.cern.ch/linuxsupport/alma9-base script: - source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_105/x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt/setup.sh - mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build - cmake .. &amp;&amp; make test-job: stage: test image: gitlab-registry.cern.ch/linuxsupport/alma9-base script: - source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_105/x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt/setup.sh - cd build &amp;&amp; ctest CERN provides shared runners with tags like cvmfs for accessing experiment software stacks. Check your project's CI settings or ask your team about the preferred runner configuration. Useful Repositories for Newcomers Here are some commonly referenced repositories and groups on CERN GitLab: Experiment frameworks: Each major experiment (ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, ALICE) has its own GitLab group containing the analysis and reconstruction frameworks. Ask your supervisor for the specific repositories you need. CERN IT tools: The cern-it and linuxsupport groups contain infrastructure tools, container images, and system configurations. ROOT project: The ROOT framework itself is developed on GitHub ( github.com/root-project/root ) but many ROOT-based tools and packages live on CERN GitLab. Documentation projects: Many groups maintain their documentation as GitLab Pages sites (using mkdocs, sphinx, or similar). Explore your experiment's docs group for guides and tutorials.

Read this page carefully and act within the required timeframes. CHIS: Your Primary Coverage The CERN Health Insurance Scheme (CHIS) is your primary health coverage. All CERN employees are enrolled automatically upon joining. CHIS covers medical expenses, hospitalisation, dental (partial), maternity, and emergency care in Switzerland, France, and abroad. Your registered family members (spouse, children) can also be covered under CHIS. Register them through the CERN HR department as soon as possible. CHIS is not a state insurance — it is CERN's own scheme, managed independently from Swiss or French national systems. If You Live in Switzerland Exemption from LAMal: CERN staff holding a carte de legitimation are exempt from the Swiss mandatory health insurance (LAMal). You do not need to enrol in a Swiss health insurance plan. Family members: If your spouse or family members do not hold CERN status and work in Switzerland, they may need their own LAMal coverage. Check with the cantonal office (Office cantonal de l'assurance maladie, Geneva). No action needed: If you and your family are fully covered by CHIS and nobody works outside CERN in Switzerland, no additional insurance is required. Optional LAMal: You may voluntarily opt into LAMal for additional coverage. Compare premiums at priminfo.admin.ch before deciding. If You Live in France (Cross-border — Critical) &#9888;&#65039; If you live in France, you must make a health insurance choice within 3 months of registering your residence. This choice is normally irreversible. The Droit d'Option As a cross-border worker (frontalier) living in France and working at CERN, you have the right to choose between three health coverage options: Option A — CHIS only: Keep your CERN insurance as your sole coverage. No affiliation with the French system. Simplest option for most CERN employees. Option B — French system (CMU/PUMA): Affiliate with the French social security system via CPAM (Caisse Primaire d'Assurance Maladie). You would pay contributions to URSSAF based on your income. This provides access to the full French healthcare network. Option C — Swiss LAMal: Enrol in Swiss mandatory health insurance at the frontalier rate. Provides coverage in both Switzerland and France but involves Swiss premium payments. Deadline and Process 3-month deadline: You have 3 months from the date you register your residence in France (at the mairie) to exercise your droit d'option. If you miss this deadline, you may be automatically assigned to the French system. Irreversible choice: Once you exercise the droit d'option, your choice is normally permanent for as long as you remain in the same situation (same employer, same country of residence). S1 form: If you choose CHIS only (Option A), you may need an S1 form to prove you have health coverage. CERN's HR department can help you obtain the necessary documentation. Where to declare: Submit your choice to CPAM de l'Ain (if you live in the Pays de Gex area) or the relevant CPAM for your department. CHIS Reimbursement: How It Works Claims portal: Submit reimbursement claims through the CHIS online portal or by sending paper forms to the CHIS office at CERN. Receipts: Keep all medical receipts, prescriptions, and invoices. You will need to attach them to your claim. Reimbursement rates: CHIS reimburses a percentage of eligible costs (typically 80-90% for most services). Check the CHIS schedule of benefits for exact rates. Emergency abroad: CHIS provides emergency coverage worldwide. Keep your CHIS card with you when travelling and contact the CHIS office for pre-authorisation if possible.

Your CERN access card is collected at the CERN Reception (Building 33). Bring your passport or national ID and your contract documentation. The Users Office will guide you through the process during your first day. See the CERN Admin e-Guide for details. Why doesn't my computing account work? Your CERN computing account may take 24-48 hours to become fully active after creation. If it still doesn't work, try resetting your password at account.cern.ch . For persistent issues, contact the CERN Service Desk. Do I need a Swiss bank account? CERN can pay your salary to a bank account in most countries. A local Swiss or French account is useful for paying rent and local bills. Many CERN employees also use multi-currency digital banks like Wise or Revolut. What is EDH and how do I use it? EDH (Electronic Document Handling) is CERN's system for administrative processes: travel requests, leave applications, expense claims, and more. Access it through the CERN intranet. Your supervisor can help you get started with your first requests. Health Insurance I live in France — what do I do about health insurance? You have 3 months from registering your French residence to exercise your \"droit d'option\" — choosing between CHIS only, the French system (CMU/PUMA), or Swiss LAMal. Most CERN employees choose CHIS only. See our Health Insurance guide for full details. Can I change my health insurance choice later? Generally no. The droit d'option choice is normally irreversible as long as your situation stays the same (same employer, same country of residence). A change of circumstances (e.g., moving from France to Switzerland) may allow a new choice. How do I submit a CHIS reimbursement claim? Submit claims through the CHIS online portal or send paper forms to the CHIS office at CERN. Always keep original receipts and prescriptions. Reimbursement typically covers 80-90% of eligible costs. Housing &amp; Transport Should I live in Switzerland or France? Both have advantages. Switzerland (Geneva) is closer to CERN and has excellent public transport but is very expensive. France (Pays de Gex) is much more affordable but may require a car. See our Housing guide for a detailed comparison. How do I get a transport pass? For Geneva public transport (TPG), purchase a Unireso monthly pass at TPG offices or online at tpg.ch. CERN may offer subsidised transport passes — check with HR. Lines 66 and 68 serve CERN directly. Is a car necessary? Not if you live in Geneva or close to a bus line serving CERN. If you live in some parts of the Pays de Gex (France), a car is very helpful as public transport options are more limited. CERN also runs internal shuttle buses between its sites. Legal &amp; Admin Do I need to register at a commune/mairie? Yes. If you live in Switzerland, register at your commune's Office de la population. If you live in France, register at the mairie of your town. CERN staff in Switzerland receive a carte de legitimation instead of a standard residence permit. What is the carte de legitimation? The carte de legitimation is a special identity document issued by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs to international organisation employees. It replaces a standard residence permit and grants certain privileges, including exemption from Swiss income tax and LAMal. Do I need to file taxes in France? If you live in France, you must file an annual French tax return even though your CERN salary is exempt from French income tax. You declare your situation and the exemption applies. Other income (rental, investments) may be taxable in France. Tech How do I connect to eduroam Wi-Fi? Use your CERN credentials (username@cern.ch and your CERN password) to connect to the eduroam network. For the best setup, use the eduroam CAT tool at cat.eduroam.org. The CERN-GUEST network is available as a fallback. How do I access lxplus from home? Connect via SSH: ssh username@lxplus.cern.ch . You will need Kerberos authentication or an SSH key configured in your CERN account. See our Kerberos &amp; SSH guide for setup instructions. What is ServiceNow? ServiceNow is CERN's central platform for IT support tickets, HR requests, facility issues, and general service requests. Access it at cern.service-now.com using your CERN credentials. It replaces the old ticketing system. &#128424; Print this page"},{"title":"CERN IT Basics - CERN Starter Pack","url":"/en/technical/cern-it-basics.html","content":"CERN IT Basics - CERN Starter Pack Skip to main content Home / Technical Help / CERN IT Basics CERN IT Basics for Newcomers Last updated: February 2026 Your CERN Computing Account Activation: Visit account.cern.ch to activate your CERN computing account.

Always verify with the bank directly before opening an account. Why You Need Bank Accounts CERN pays salaries in Swiss francs (CHF), so a Swiss bank account is essential for receiving your salary. If you live in France, you will need a French bank account for rent payments, utilities, and direct debits in euros (EUR). Living near the Swiss-French border means you deal with two currencies daily. Having accounts in both currencies simplifies payments and avoids costly exchange fees. Swiss Bank Accounts Main banks: UBS and BCGE (Banque Cantonale de Geneve) are the most commonly used by CERN employees. Credit Suisse has been integrated into UBS. Required documents: Carte de legitimation (issued by CERN/DFAE), valid passport or ID, employment contract or CERN attestation, and proof of address (if available). Typical fees: CHF 5-15 per month for account maintenance, depending on the bank and account type. Some banks offer reduced fees for CERN staff. Opening process: Book an appointment at the branch (in-person required for most Swiss banks). Bring all documents. The account is usually active within a few business days. A debit card (Maestro or Visa Debit) is issued by post. French Bank Accounts Traditional banks: BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, and Credit Agricole have branches in Saint-Genis-Pouilly and Ferney-Voltaire near CERN. Online banks: Boursorama and Fortuneo offer fee-free current accounts and are popular with CERN employees living in France. Fully digital application process. Required documents: Titre de sejour or attestation from the prefecture, valid passport or ID, proof of address in France (utility bill or rental contract), and employment contract. Opening process: Traditional banks require an in-person appointment. Online banks can be opened remotely in a few days. A French RIB (Releve d'Identite Bancaire) is needed for rent and utility payments. On-Site Banking at CERN UBS branch: There is a UBS branch located at CERN (Building 504) specifically serving CERN personnel. Staff there are experienced with the carte de legitimation and CERN employment contracts. ATMs: UBS and BCGE ATMs are available on the CERN Meyrin site for cash withdrawals in CHF. Opening hours: The on-site UBS branch typically operates on limited hours (mornings only on certain weekdays). Check the CERN website or internal directory for current hours. Appointments: It is recommended to book an appointment in advance, especially during arrival periods (September-October) when many newcomers open accounts simultaneously. Multi-Currency &amp; Digital Banks Wise (formerly TransferWise): Very popular among CERN employees. Offers multi-currency accounts with real exchange rates and low fees. Ideal for CHF/EUR conversions and international transfers. Revolut: Provides multi-currency accounts, free card payments abroad, and competitive exchange rates. Useful for daily cross-border spending. N26: German digital bank offering free euro accounts. Available to French residents. Good as a secondary EUR account. Limitations: Digital banks may not always be accepted for salary deposits by CERN. They also may lack French RIB functionality needed for some direct debits. Best used as complementary accounts rather than primary ones. Salary Payment Currency: CERN pays all salaries in Swiss francs (CHF). You will need to provide a CHF-denominated IBAN to the HR department. Split payments: CERN allows you to split your salary between multiple bank accounts (e.g., part in CHF to a Swiss account, part converted to EUR to a French account). Contact HR/payroll to set this up. First payment: Your first salary payment may take 4-6 weeks after your start date. Plan to have enough savings to cover your initial expenses (deposit, rent, living costs) during this period. Tips Open Swiss first: Prioritise opening a Swiss bank account as soon as possible after arrival so you can receive your salary without delay. French account if needed: If you live in France, open a French account for rent, utilities, and local payments. Many landlords require a French RIB for direct debit. Use Wise/Revolut daily: For everyday cross-border spending (groceries in France, coffee in Switzerland), digital banks offer the best exchange rates and lowest fees. Avoid airport exchanges: Currency exchange offices at Geneva airport and in tourist areas charge high commissions. Use your bank card or digital bank instead.

Always check official transport websites for the latest information. Getting to CERN Meyrin site: The main CERN campus is located in Meyrin, Switzerland, accessible via Entrance B on Route de Meyrin. This is where most offices, restaurants, and the main reception are located. Prevessin site: The second CERN campus is in Prevessin-Moens, France. It hosts several experimental areas and offices. A free CERN shuttle connects the two sites. Main options: You can reach CERN by public bus, CERN shuttle, bicycle, car, or regional train (to nearby stations). The best option depends on where you live. Public Transport (TPG) Bus line 68: The most important bus for CERN employees. It runs from Geneva city centre (Rive) through Meyrin to the CERN stop. Frequency is every 10-15 minutes during peak hours. Tram 18: Tram line 18 runs from Plan-les-Ouates through Geneva to CERN (the terminus). It is the fastest public transport link between Geneva centre and CERN, taking about 25 minutes from Cornavin station. Unireso zones and passes: The Geneva area uses the Unireso fare system. A monthly pass costs approximately CHF 70 and covers all TPG buses, trams, and local trains within the selected zones. Buying tickets: Tickets can be purchased via the TPG app (recommended), at ticket machines at major stops, or on board (with a surcharge). Contactless payment is accepted on some machines. CERN Shuttle Free service: CERN operates a free internal shuttle bus between the Meyrin and Prevessin sites. Available to all CERN personnel and visitors with a valid access card. Schedule: The shuttle runs every 15-20 minutes during standard working hours (approximately 08:00 to 18:00, Monday to Friday). Check the CERN transport page for the current timetable. Route: The shuttle connects key buildings on both sites, with stops at the main entrances and major building clusters. Cycling Flat terrain: The area around CERN is generally flat, making cycling a practical and popular commuting option, especially from Meyrin and Saint-Genis-Pouilly. Bike racks: CERN provides bike racks at most buildings across both sites. Covered racks are available near main entrances. Bike-sharing: Geneva offers bike-sharing services such as Donkey Republic. Stations are available near CERN and throughout the city. Bike paths: Dedicated bike paths connect Meyrin and Saint-Genis-Pouilly to CERN. The route from Geneva centre follows well-marked paths along Route de Meyrin. Electric bikes: Electric bike rental services are available in Geneva and nearby towns. Some CERN employees use e-bikes for the slightly longer commute from Ferney-Voltaire or Gex. Driving &amp; Parking Parking: Parking is available at both CERN sites but can be limited, especially at Meyrin during peak hours. A CERN access card is required for the parking barriers. Cross-border commuting: Many employees living in France commute by car. The border crossing near CERN (Entrance E) is usually quick but can have delays during rush hour. French motorway vignette: Not needed for local roads in the Pays de Gex area. Only required if using French motorways further afield. Swiss vignette: A Swiss motorway vignette costs CHF 40 per year and is required for using Swiss motorways. Available at border crossings, post offices, and petrol stations. Regional Trains Leman Express: The regional train network connecting Geneva to Annemasse and the Annecy corridor. Useful if you live south of the border or in towns along the line. SBB/CFF: Swiss Federal Railways operates frequent trains between Geneva (Cornavin) and Lausanne, as well as connections to the rest of Switzerland. The Geneva station is about 20 minutes from CERN by bus. For longer commutes: If you live further from CERN (e.g., Nyon, Lausanne, Annemasse), combining train and bus can be an efficient commute option. From Geneva Airport By bus/tram: Take bus 23, 28, or 57 from the airport to Blandonnet, then transfer to tram 18 or bus 68 towards CERN. The total journey takes about 25-35 minutes depending on connections. By taxi: A taxi from Geneva airport to CERN costs approximately CHF 40-50 and takes about 10-15 minutes by car depending on traffic. Proximity: CERN is very close to Geneva airport (approximately 5 km). This makes it convenient for international travel and for visitors arriving by air.

Always check with official sources for the latest regulations. Why Cross-Border Shopping? Price differences: There are significant price differences between Switzerland and France. Groceries and everyday items can be 20-40% cheaper in France compared to Swiss supermarkets. Common practice: Many CERN employees, whether living in Switzerland or France, regularly shop across the border to save money on groceries, wine, and household products. Proximity: French supermarkets in Saint-Genis-Pouilly and Ferney-Voltaire are just minutes from CERN, making cross-border shopping easy and practical. French Supermarkets Carrefour: Located in Saint-Genis-Pouilly. Large hypermarket with a wide selection of food, household goods, and electronics. Competitive prices. Leclerc: Branches in Thoiry and Ferney-Voltaire. Known for competitive pricing. The Thoiry location has a large shopping centre with additional stores. Lidl: Budget supermarket with locations near Saint-Genis and Ferney. Great for staples and weekly special offers on non-food items. Intermarche: Available in several nearby towns. Good selection of French products, local cheeses, and wines at reasonable prices. Opening hours: Typically 8:30 to 19:30 (Monday to Saturday). Some supermarkets open on Sunday mornings until 12:30. Hours may vary by location and season. Swiss Supermarkets Migros: Switzerland's largest supermarket chain. Good quality own-brand products. Higher prices than France but convenient for quick stops. Does not sell alcohol. Coop: Second-largest Swiss chain. Wider product range including alcohol. Slightly higher prices than Migros for most items. Lidl and Aldi: Swiss branches of these discount chains offer lower prices than Migros/Coop, though still generally higher than French equivalents. Comparison: For a typical weekly shop, you may save CHF 50-100 by shopping in France instead of Switzerland, depending on what you buy. Customs &amp; Tax-Free Value limit: When importing goods from France to Switzerland for personal use, there is a CHF 300 value limit per person per day. Below this amount, no customs duties apply. Green/red channels: At the border crossing, use the green channel if you have nothing to declare (under the limit). Use the red channel if you exceed the limit or carry restricted items. VAT refund (detaxe): Swiss residents can claim a VAT refund on purchases made in France above a certain threshold. Ask for a detaxe form at the shop checkout and have it stamped at the French border customs. Common limits: Specific limits apply to certain goods: 1 kg of meat, 1 kg of butter, 5 litres of wine, and 1 litre of spirits per person per day when entering Switzerland. Amounts above these limits are subject to duties. Sunday &amp; Holiday Hours Switzerland: Most shops are closed on Sundays, except those at train stations (Geneva Cornavin) and some convenience stores in the city centre. Shops in Geneva may open on the first Sunday of the month. France: Some supermarkets open on Sunday mornings until around 12:30. Bakeries and small food shops often open Sunday mornings as well. Public holidays: Switzerland and France have different public holidays. A shop may be open on one side of the border while closed on the other. Check local calendars to plan ahead. Farmers Markets Ferney-Voltaire: Saturday morning market in the town centre. Fresh local produce, cheese, bread, flowers, and regional specialities. One of the best markets in the area. Gex: Thursday morning market. Smaller but with excellent local products from the Jura region, including Comte cheese and cured meats. Geneva (Plainpalais): Large open-air market on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. Wide variety of fresh produce, artisan goods, and international food stalls. Fresh produce: Markets offer seasonal, locally sourced fruits, vegetables, dairy, and meats at competitive prices. A great way to discover regional French and Swiss products. Tips Keep receipts: Always keep your shopping receipts when crossing the border. Customs officers may ask to see them, and you will need them for any VAT refund claims. Use Wise/Revolut for EUR: If your salary is in CHF, use a multi-currency card (Wise, Revolut) for paying in euros at French shops to get the best exchange rate. Stock up on French goods: Wine, cheese, bread, and fresh produce are significantly cheaper and often better quality in France. Many CERN employees do a large weekly shop in France. Pharmacies: Prescription and over-the-counter medicines are generally cheaper in French pharmacies than in Swiss ones. The pharmacy in Saint-Genis-Pouilly is a popular option.

Start researching and registering as early as possible, ideally before your arrival at CERN. CERN Childcare: Le Jardin des Particules Le Jardin des Particules is the CERN on-site creche, accepting children from 4 months to 6 years of age. It is managed by the CERN Staff Association and located on the Meyrin site. Places are reserved for children of CERN employees and associated personnel. There is typically a significant waitlist. Apply as soon as you receive your CERN contract, or even earlier if possible, through CERN HR. Fees are income-dependent and generally competitive compared to local private nurseries in the Geneva area. Local Nurseries (Creches) Swiss creches: Available in Meyrin, Vernier, and surrounding communes. Managed by the commune or private operators. Registration is usually done through the commune's early childhood office (Service de la petite enfance). French creches: Available in Saint-Genis-Pouilly, Ferney-Voltaire, and nearby towns. Managed by the commune or associations. Contact the local Relais Petite Enfance for availability. Registration timelines: Apply early — waiting lists of 6 months or more are common on both sides of the border. Some communes require registration before the child is born. Cost comparison: Swiss creches tend to be more expensive (CHF 100-150/day) but fees are often income-adjusted. French creches are generally cheaper (EUR 5-30/day depending on income and CAF subsidies). Primary & Secondary Schools Swiss public schools: Free and French-language. Children are assigned to the school in their commune of residence. The school year starts in late August. Registration is done through the commune. French public schools: Free and French-language. Registration is at the local mairie. The school year starts in September. Children are assigned based on their catchment area (carte scolaire). School year differences: Swiss schools (Canton of Geneva) start in late August, while French schools start in September. School holidays also differ between the two countries. Integration classes: Both Swiss and French public schools offer integration support (classes d'accueil in Geneva, UPE2A in France) for children who do not yet speak French. International Schools International School of Geneva (Ecolint): The oldest international school in the world, with multiple campuses (La Grande Boissiere, Nations, La Chataigneraie). Offers IB curriculum in English and French. Tuition ranges from CHF 20,000 to CHF 35,000 per year. Campus des Nations: A campus of Ecolint located near the UN in Geneva, convenient for families living on the Swiss side. Lycee International de Ferney-Voltaire: A French public school with international sections (English, German, etc.). Free tuition with a small fee for the international section. Very popular with CERN families on the French side. Geneva English School: A private English-language primary school in Geneva following the English National Curriculum. CERN education grants: CERN provides education grants for staff members' children attending school. This can partially offset international school tuition. Check with CERN HR for eligibility and amounts. Higher Education & After-School Activities Nearby universities: The University of Geneva (UniGE) and EPFL/University of Lausanne are within easy reach for older students or accompanying partners. After-school programs: Swiss communes offer garderies (after-school care) and parascolaire activities. In France, centres aeres and garderies periscolaires provide similar services. Sports clubs: Numerous sports clubs for children are available through local communes, the CERN Staff Association, and private organizations in the area. Tips for Families Register early: For creches and popular international schools, apply as soon as possible — ideally 6-12 months in advance. CERN education grants: If your children attend a fee-paying school, check with CERN HR about education grant eligibility. The grant can cover a significant portion of tuition. Check catchment areas: If you plan to use public schools, verify the catchment area (secteur scolaire) before choosing your housing. Bilingual advantage: The Geneva region offers a unique bilingual environment. Children attending local schools will naturally develop French skills alongside their home language.

Start setting up accounts before your move-in date to avoid delays. Overview Switzerland and France have different utility providers, billing systems, and regulations. Your setup process depends entirely on which side of the border you live. In Switzerland, many utilities are bundled with the rental contract or handled automatically by the landlord. In France, tenants typically need to open their own accounts. Plan to set up utilities 1-2 weeks before your move-in date. Internet installation may take longer, especially in France. Electricity & Gas Switzerland (Geneva): SIG (Services Industriels de Geneve) is the sole provider for electricity, gas, and water in the Canton of Geneva. Your account is typically activated automatically when you sign your rental contract. You may need to contact SIG to confirm the transfer. France: EDF is the main electricity provider and Engie (formerly GDF Suez) for gas. You need to open an account by calling or registering online. Setup takes approximately 2 weeks. Have your new address and move-in date ready. French monthly costs: Expect approximately EUR 80-150 per month for electricity and gas combined, depending on apartment size and heating type. Meter readings: Take note of your electricity and gas meter readings on the day you move in. This protects you from being charged for the previous tenant's consumption. Water Switzerland: Water is provided by SIG and is usually included in the rental charges (charges communes). You typically do not need a separate water subscription. France: Water supply varies by commune. In some areas it is included in the communal charges; in others, you may need a separate subscription with the local water provider (e.g., Suez, Veolia, or the communal water service). Tap water quality: Tap water is safe to drink on both sides of the border. Geneva and the Pays de Gex area have excellent water quality. Internet & Mobile Switzerland: Main providers are Swisscom, Sunrise, and Salt. Fibre optic is widely available in the Geneva area. Expect to pay CHF 50-80 per month for broadband internet. France: Main providers are Orange, Free (very popular, EUR 20-40/month), SFR, and Bouygues Telecom. Free's Freebox is particularly popular for its competitive pricing and includes a TV service. Cross-border options: If you live in France and work at CERN, consider a French mobile plan with EU roaming (covers Switzerland for calls). Some providers offer specific cross-border packages. CERN Wi-Fi: CERN provides eduroam Wi-Fi on all sites. Your CERN credentials give you access. You can also use eduroam at universities and research institutions worldwide. eSIM: Most modern phones support eSIM. This can be convenient for having both a Swiss and French number without carrying two physical SIM cards. TV License Switzerland: The Serafe fee is CHF 335 per year and is mandatory for all households, regardless of whether you own a TV or radio. It is billed separately and cannot be avoided. France: The contribution a l'audiovisuel public has been phased out as of 2022. You no longer need to pay a TV license fee in France. Waste & Recycling Switzerland: Geneva uses taxed garbage bags (sacs taxe) costing approximately CHF 2 per 35-litre bag. You must use official bags purchased from supermarkets. Recycling is strongly encouraged and free — separate paper, glass, PET, aluminium, and organic waste. Dechetterie: Each Swiss commune has a recycling centre (dechetterie) where you can drop off bulky items, electronics, and hazardous waste for free. France: Waste collection is included in local taxes (taxe d'habitation/taxe fonciere). Sorting rules are less strict than in Switzerland, but recycling is increasingly required. Yellow bins are for recyclables, green for glass. Tips Open accounts early: Contact utility providers 1-2 weeks before moving in to ensure everything is active on your arrival date. Keep all contracts: Store copies of all utility contracts and correspondence. You will need them for administrative procedures and when moving out. Bundled packages: In France, consider bundling internet, mobile, and TV with the same provider (e.g., Free) for savings. In Switzerland, Swisscom and Sunrise offer similar bundles. Meter readings at move-in: Always note electricity, gas, and water meter readings when you move in and when you move out. Take photos as evidence.

Misuse or failure to return them when leaving can result in fines and customs issues. Follow all procedures carefully. Green Plates Overview CERN international staff with a carte de legitimation are eligible for CD (Corps Diplomatique) green plates, which allow tax-free vehicle registration in Switzerland. Green plates are issued by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) through CERN's Host States Relations service. The duration of your green plates is linked to your CERN contract. When your contract ends, you must return or convert your plates. Vehicles with green plates are exempt from Swiss customs duty and TVA (VAT) on purchase. This can represent significant savings. Only international staff members (not fellows or associates without a carte de legitimation) are typically eligible for green plates. Bringing Your Car Temporary importation: You can bring your existing car into Switzerland temporarily (up to 1 year) without paying customs duties, provided you have owned the vehicle for at least 6 months before arriving. Definitive importation: If you want to keep your car permanently, you must go through the customs clearance process. Present your purchase invoice, original registration, and proof of insurance at Geneva customs. Required documents: Original vehicle registration certificate, purchase invoice or proof of ownership, valid insurance certificate (green card), passport, and CERN carte de legitimation. Timing: Start the importation process as soon as possible after arriving. Delays can complicate the customs procedure. Contact CERN's Host States Relations service for guidance. Buying a Car in Switzerland Tax-free purchase: With green plates, you can buy a new car in Switzerland without paying TVA (currently 7.7%). This can save thousands of francs on a new vehicle. Process: Choose your vehicle at a Swiss dealership, inform them you will register with green plates. The dealership will prepare the invoice without TVA. CERN's Host States Relations service handles the registration paperwork. Registration steps: Submit the purchase invoice and insurance certificate to CERN's Host States Relations. They will process the green plate registration with the Swiss authorities. You will receive your plates and vehicle registration document. Dealerships: Most major Swiss dealerships are familiar with the green plate process for international organisations. Some near CERN (Geneva area) have dedicated staff for this. Buying a Car in France No tax exemption: Unlike Switzerland, buying a car in France does not benefit from any tax exemption linked to your CERN status. You will pay full French TVA (20%). Second-hand market: France has a large second-hand car market. Websites like leboncoin.fr and La Centrale are popular for finding used vehicles. Carte grise: To register a car in France, you need a carte grise (vehicle registration certificate). Apply online at the ANTS (Agence Nationale des Titres Securises) website or through an approved garage. Controle technique: Cars over 4 years old must pass a controle technique (MOT equivalent) every 2 years. Ensure any used car you buy has a valid controle technique certificate. Driving License International driving permit: An international driving permit (IDP) together with your national license is valid in Switzerland for up to 12 months from your arrival date. Exchanging to Swiss license: After 12 months, you must exchange your license for a Swiss one. Switzerland has agreements with many countries allowing a direct exchange without a driving test. CERN assistance: CERN's Host States Relations service can help you with the license exchange process, including providing the necessary attestations. No driving test: If your country has a bilateral agreement with Switzerland (most EU/EFTA countries, USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, and others), you can exchange your license without taking a Swiss driving test. France residents: If you live in France and hold a non-EU license, you may also need to exchange it for a French license. EU licenses are valid throughout France without exchange. Insurance Mandatory: Third-party liability insurance (responsabilite civile) is mandatory in both Switzerland and France. You cannot register a vehicle without proof of insurance. CERN group rates: CERN has negotiated group insurance rates with several providers. Check with the Staff Association or Host States Relations for current offers — they can be significantly cheaper than individual quotes. Swiss vs French insurance: If your car has green plates (Swiss registration), you need Swiss insurance. If registered in France with a carte grise, you need French insurance. TCS membership: Consider joining the Touring Club Suisse (TCS) for roadside assistance, legal protection, and travel insurance. CERN staff often get discounted membership rates. Parking at CERN Parking sticker: Apply for a CERN parking sticker through ADaMS (CERN's administrative database). You will need your vehicle registration details. Meyrin site: Parking at the Meyrin site is limited and spaces fill up early in the morning. Consider arriving before 8:30 or using alternative transport. Prevessin site: The Prevessin site generally has more parking availability than Meyrin. Free shuttle buses connect the two sites. Electric charging: CERN has installed electric vehicle charging stations at both Meyrin and Prevessin sites. Check the CERN maps for locations and availability. Selling Your Car / Leaving CERN Returning green plates: When your CERN contract ends, you must return your green plates to CERN's Host States Relations service. This is mandatory and failure to do so can result in penalties. Re-export: If you are leaving Switzerland, you can re-export your vehicle to your home country or another destination without paying Swiss import duties. Selling in Switzerland: If you want to sell your green-plated car in Switzerland, the buyer must pay the customs duty and TVA that were originally exempted. Factor this into the sale price. Timeline: Start the process at least 2-3 months before your departure date. Notify Host States Relations, arrange insurance cancellation, and complete the plate return procedure.

Register as soon as enrollment opens to secure your spot, especially for French beginner levels. Working Language at CERN CERN's two official languages are English and French. All official documents and communications are available in both languages. In practice, most day-to-day technical work, meetings, and emails are conducted in English. You can work comfortably at CERN without speaking French. However, French is extremely useful for daily life outside CERN — shopping, dealing with local administration, visiting doctors, and socialising with neighbours. There is no strict requirement to speak French to work at CERN, but learning at least basic French will significantly improve your quality of life in the Geneva region. CERN Language Courses Languages offered: CERN offers subsidised courses in French, English, German, Spanish, Italian, and occasionally other languages depending on demand. Subsidised by CERN: Courses are heavily subsidised for CERN personnel. You only pay a small fraction of the actual cost, making them an excellent value. Schedule: Classes are offered during and after working hours. Lunchtime and evening slots are the most popular. Each course typically runs for one semester. Levels: Courses follow the CEFR framework (A1 to C2). A placement test determines your starting level. Most newcomers start at A1 or A2 for French. Enrollment: Register through the CERN Learning Hub (learning.cern.ch). Enrollment periods are announced via email and on the CERN intranet. Act fast — courses fill up within hours. Welcome Club Language Classes Affordable group classes: The CERN Welcome Club offers affordable French classes aimed primarily at partners and family members of CERN personnel. Focus on beginners: Classes focus mainly on French for beginners and intermediate learners, with an emphasis on practical everyday communication. Social aspect: Beyond language learning, Welcome Club classes are a great way to meet other newcomers and build a social network in the CERN community. Registration: Check the Welcome Club website for current offerings, schedules, and registration details. Classes typically start at the beginning of each semester. CAGI Resources CAGI: The Centre d'Accueil de la Geneve Internationale helps international workers and their families settle in Geneva, including language support. Conversation exchange: CAGI organises conversation exchange programs where you can practice French with native speakers who want to practice your language in return. Tandem partners: Sign up for tandem language partnerships — you meet regularly with a partner and split the time between practising each other's languages. Integration workshops: CAGI runs workshops on Swiss and French culture, local customs, and practical life topics — all helpful for language and cultural integration. Local Options Alliance Francaise de Geneve: Well-established French language school offering group and private courses at all levels. Recognised certificates available. Universite Populaire du Canton de Geneve: Offers affordable French courses for all levels, as well as other languages and cultural classes. Commune integration courses (France): If you live in France (Pays de Gex area), your local commune or communaute de communes may offer free or low-cost French integration courses. Migros Club School: Switzerland's largest adult education provider offers French and other language courses at competitive prices across Geneva canton. Online platforms: Platforms like italki and Preply connect you with professional French tutors for private online lessons at flexible times and prices. Self-Study &amp; Apps Duolingo: Free app with gamified French lessons. Good for building vocabulary and basic grammar, especially for absolute beginners. Babbel: Subscription-based app with structured French courses designed by linguists. More in-depth grammar explanations than Duolingo. TV5Monde: Free French-language media platform with news, shows, and dedicated language-learning exercises for all CEFR levels. RFI — Journal en francais facile: Daily news broadcast in simplified French. Excellent for intermediate learners to improve listening comprehension. Immersion: Listen to French radio (France Inter, RTS La Premiere), watch French TV (TF1, France 2), and switch your phone and apps to French for passive daily exposure. Tips for Learning Start before arriving: If possible, begin learning basic French before you move to Geneva. Even a few weeks of self-study will make your first days much easier. Register early: CERN courses fill up within hours of opening. Set a reminder for the enrollment date and register immediately when it opens. Practice with locals: Use every opportunity to speak French — at the market, in shops, at the boulangerie. Locals appreciate the effort even if your French is not perfect. Join social activities: Attend French-speaking social events, conversation groups, or join a local sports club where French is the common language.

Many CERN support programmes have application windows and eligibility conditions — start the process as soon as you receive your contract. Relocating with Family CERN provides relocation support for employees arriving with their families. Contact the CERN Housing Service and HR department early to understand available assistance. A settling-in allowance may be available depending on your contract type. This one-time payment helps cover initial expenses such as deposits, temporary accommodation, and moving costs. The CERN Housing Service can assist with your housing search, providing listings and advice for both the Swiss and French sides of the border. Family checklist: Gather all necessary documents (passports, marriage certificates, birth certificates, translated and apostilled), arrange school enrolment, and plan health insurance coverage for all family members before arrival. Spouses &amp; Partners Forum The CERN Spouses &amp; Partners Forum is a CERN-supported network for the partners and spouses of CERN personnel. It helps newcomers integrate into life in the Geneva area. The forum organises regular meetings, social events, language courses, and cultural activities throughout the year. Career advice sessions and workshops are available to help partners explore employment and professional development opportunities in Switzerland and France. To connect with the forum, visit the CERN Welcome Club website or contact the CERN Staff Association for meeting schedules and registration details. Dual Career Support CERN runs a Dual Career programme specifically designed to support the professional lives of partners who relocate to the Geneva area. The programme offers career workshops, CV review sessions, and interview preparation tailored to the local Swiss and French job markets. Networking events connect partners with local employers, international organisations, and other professionals in the region. Job search resources include access to local job boards, guidance on Swiss and French employment practices, and information about work permits for non-EU nationals. Partner Employment Work rights for partners depend on the country of residence and the type of permit held. The rules differ significantly between Switzerland and France. Swiss carte de legitimation: Partners holding a dependent carte de legitimation may face restrictions on taking up paid employment in Switzerland. Check with the Swiss Mission or HR for your specific situation. French titre de sejour: If you reside in France, partners may benefit from more flexible work authorisation rules. A titre de sejour obtained through the French authorities can allow employment in France. International organisations: Partners can also explore employment at other international organisations in Geneva (UN, WHO, ILO, WTO, etc.), which may have their own hiring processes for family members of international civil servants. Family Allowances CERN provides family allowances including a child allowance for each dependent child. The amount varies based on the child's age and educational status. Education grants are available for children attending school or university, helping to cover tuition fees and related educational expenses. How to apply: Submit your application through the CERN HR portal. You will need birth certificates, proof of dependency, and educational enrolment documents. Apply promptly after joining CERN — allowances are generally not paid retroactively for extended periods. Keep HR updated if your family situation changes (new child, change in schooling, etc.). Childcare &amp; Parenting CERN does not operate its own creche, but the CERN Staff Association and Welcome Club maintain up-to-date lists of childcare options near CERN on both the Swiss and French sides. Parenting networks and baby/toddler groups operate through the CERN Welcome Club. These groups meet regularly and provide a support network for new parents in the area. Family-friendly events are organised throughout the year, including holiday activities, outings, and workshops for children of various ages. For detailed information on schools and childcare facilities, see the dedicated childcare and schools page on this site. Tips Join the Spouses Forum early: Connect with other families before or immediately after arrival. The forum is one of the best resources for settling in. Check partner work permit eligibility: Understand the work restrictions associated with your permit type before your partner starts a job search. Apply for family allowances promptly: Do not delay — submit your allowance applications as soon as you have the required documents. Connect with the Welcome Club families section: The Welcome Club organises activities specifically for families with children and is an excellent way to build a social network.

It has an emergency department for less critical cases. Meyrin medical centres: Several medical centres and clinics in Meyrin and surrounding areas offer walk-in appointments and minor urgent care during business hours. Finding a Doctor To find a general practitioner (medecin generaliste), you can register with a local doctor near your residence. In Switzerland, you do not always need a referral to see a specialist, but some insurance plans require one. Swiss system: Use online directories or ask your commune for a list of local doctors accepting new patients. Waiting lists can be long in the Geneva area. French system: Register with a medecin traitant (primary care doctor) through the French healthcare system. This is recommended to receive full reimbursement rates. The CERN Medical Service can recommend doctors and specialists in the area. Ask at your next appointment or contact them by phone. Pharmacies Swiss pharmacies: Several pharmacies are located in Meyrin and Vernier, close to CERN. They are open during standard business hours and can dispense prescriptions from Swiss or CERN doctors. French pharmacies: Pharmacies in Saint-Genis-Pouilly and Ferney-Voltaire serve the French side of the border. They accept French prescriptions and some Swiss prescriptions. Sunday/night pharmacies (pharmacie de garde): A rotating schedule determines which pharmacy is open on Sundays, holidays, and at night. Check the local pharmacie de garde schedule online or on the pharmacy door. Prescriptions from CERN Medical Service are generally accepted at both Swiss and French pharmacies. Keep your CHIS card with you for reimbursement purposes. Mental Health CERN provides psychological support through the CERN Medical Service. You can request an appointment with a psychologist through the standard booking process. Employee Assistance Programme (EAP): CERN offers a confidential Employee Assistance Programme that provides short-term counselling, crisis support, and referral services.

It does not constitute legal advice. Always consult with the CERN Users Office or a qualified advisor for your specific situation. Overview As staff of an international organisation, CERN employees have a special permit status. You do not need a standard Swiss or French work permit to work at CERN. Your legal status is managed through CERN and the host state agreements with Switzerland and France. The CERN Users Office is your main point of contact for all permit and registration matters. Swiss Carte de Legitimation What it is: The Carte de Legitimation is an identity document issued by the DFAE (Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs) that certifies your status as a member of an international organisation. Types: The type depends on your nationality and contract. Common types include B and C (with full customs privileges), D and E (limited customs privileges), P (scientific personnel), and S (Swiss nationals). Types H, F, and G have no special customs privileges. How to obtain: Obtained through the CERN Users Office, which processes the application with the DFAE on your behalf. You must register within 14 days of your arrival. Validity: The carte de legitimation validity is linked to the duration of your CERN contract. It must be renewed if your contract is extended. Benefits: The carte de legitimation exempts you from standard Swiss work and residence permits, and provides certain tax and customs advantages. French Titre de Sejour Who needs it: If you live in France (e.g. in the Pays de Gex), you need a titre de sejour (residence permit) in addition to your CERN carte de legitimation. Special category: International organisation employees have a special titre de sejour category, different from standard work permits. Where to apply: Apply at the prefecture of Ain (Bourg-en-Bresse) or the sub-prefecture corresponding to your place of residence. Documents needed: Passport, proof of address, CERN contract, carte de legitimation, passport photos, completed application form. Renewal: The titre de sejour must be renewed before its expiry date. Start the renewal process well in advance (at least 2 months before). The 14-Day Rule Obligation: You must register with the CERN Users Office within 14 days of your arrival. This is a strict requirement. What it triggers: Registration triggers the carte de legitimation application process and establishes your legal status in Switzerland. Late registration consequences: Late registration can delay your carte de legitimation, affect your health insurance coverage, and cause administrative complications. Family Members Dependent cards: Your spouse/partner and children receive their own legitimation cards as dependents of the primary holder. Spouse/partner registration: Your spouse or registered partner must be declared to the Users Office. Common-law partners may have different requirements depending on nationality. Children: Minor children are included in your registration. Adult children may require additional paperwork. Documents needed: Marriage certificate, children's birth certificates, sworn translations into English or French if documents are in another language, Hague apostille if applicable. Changing Residence Switzerland to France: If you move from Switzerland to France, you must notify the CERN Users Office, apply for a French titre de sejour, and update your address. France to Switzerland: If you move from France to Switzerland, you must register with the relevant Swiss commune and notify the Users Office. New permits needed: A change of country of residence requires new permits. The process can take several weeks, so plan ahead. Timeline: Notify the Users Office as soon as possible, ideally before the move. Deadline requirements vary by country. Practical Tips Start your paperwork immediately upon arrival. Do not wait. Keep copies of all documents (physical and digital). You will need copies on multiple occasions. The CERN Users Office is your main point of contact for any permit and registration questions. Have passport photos ready (Swiss format: 35x45 mm) for cards and permits. If you have family members, gather all necessary documents (certificates, translations) before arriving.

It does not constitute tax or legal advice. Always consult a qualified tax advisor for your specific situation. CERN Internal Tax CERN levies its own internal tax on salaries. This tax is deducted directly from your pay slip and is not a national tax. The rates are progressive, similar in structure to a national income tax, but administered internally by CERN. The internal tax has been in force since 1 January 2005, pursuant to the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities signed by Member States in 2004 and the CERN Council decision of 15 September 2005. The internal tax is mandatory for all CERN staff and is calculated automatically each month. National Income Tax Exemption CERN salaries are exempt from national income tax under the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of international organisations. This exemption applies in the host states (Switzerland and France) and in most CERN member states. The exemption applies only to CERN salary. Other income (investments, rental, freelance work) remains subject to normal taxation. French Citizens Exception French nationals working at CERN and living in France may be subject to French income tax on their CERN salary. Special provisions apply and the situation can be complex. If you are a French citizen, you must consult a tax advisor. This exception applies regardless of the type of contract you hold at CERN. Swiss Residents No Swiss income tax applies to CERN salary. However, wealth tax (impot sur la fortune) still applies at cantonal and communal level. Non-CERN income (rental, investments, self-employment) is subject to Swiss cantonal and communal taxes. You must file an annual Swiss tax return, declaring your wealth and any non-CERN income. French Residents For non-French nationals, no French income tax applies to CERN salary. However, you must still file an annual French tax return. You must declare your worldwide income, including your CERN salary, but the CERN salary is declared as exempt income. Non-CERN income (rental, investments) is subject to French income tax at standard rates. The taux effectif may apply: the exempt CERN salary can be taken into account when calculating the tax rate applicable to your other income. Outside Income Income from investments, rental property, freelance work, or other sources IS taxable in your country of residence. You must report all non-CERN income in your annual tax return in your country of residence. Double taxation treaties between countries may affect how this income is taxed. Consult a tax advisor. Spain-Specific Considerations CERN employees who maintain their tax residence in Spain have specific obligations. The CERN salary is exempt from IRPF, but it must be declared. Additionally, Modelo 720 obligations for declaring foreign assets apply when the established thresholds are exceeded. See our detailed guide on the Spanish Tax Declaration See our guide on Modelo 720 Practical Tips Keep all CERN pay slips. You will need them for your tax returns. Always declare your CERN salary in your tax return, even if it is exempt. Not declaring it can cause problems. Consult a qualified tax advisor if you have complex situations (dual residence, multiple income sources, etc.). Tax treaties between countries matter. Your situation may vary depending on your nationality and country of residence.

It does not constitute financial advice. Always consult a qualified financial advisor and CERN HR for your specific situation. Overview The CERN Pension Fund (CERN PF) is a defined-benefit scheme. This means your pension is calculated based on your years of service and salary, not just the contributions made. Membership in the CERN PF is mandatory for all CERN staff and fellows. The CERN PF is one of the largest international organisation pension funds, with professionally managed investments. Contributions Employee contribution: Approximately 10.1% of your monthly salary is automatically deducted as your pension fund contribution. CERN contribution: CERN contributes approximately 20.2% of your salary, i.e. double your personal contribution. Total: The total contribution is approximately 30.3% of your monthly salary, shared between you and CERN. Automatic deduction: Contributions are deducted monthly from your pay slip. No action is required on your part. Benefits by Years of Service Less than 5 years: If you leave CERN with fewer than 5 years of service, you receive a lump-sum transfer value. You are not entitled to a pension. 5 to 10 years: You can choose between a deferred pension (paid upon reaching retirement age) or a transfer value to another pension scheme. 10+ years: You are entitled to a pension upon reaching retirement age. The amount depends on your years of service and average salary. 15+ years: Full pension eligibility. Access to all retirement options, including early retirement with a smaller reduction. Retirement Ages Normal retirement: Age 65 if you joined the Pension Fund on or before 31 December 2011, or age 67 if you joined on or after 1 January 2012. Early retirement: Possible from age 50 (pre-2012 members) or age 52 (post-2012 members) with at least 5 years of service, but with an actuarial reduction for each year of advancement. Late retirement: It is possible to delay retirement beyond age 65 in certain circumstances, with an increase in the pension. Flexible transition: Options exist for a gradual transition to retirement, including part-time work before full retirement. Transfer Value What it is: The transfer value is a sum calculated based on your accumulated contributions plus interest. It is offered to those leaving CERN before pension eligibility. Transfer to another scheme: The value can be transferred to your new employer's pension scheme or to the national pension system of your country. Process and timing: You must elect what to do with your transfer value within 3 months of leaving CERN. Payment or transfer is processed once your request is submitted. Pension Calculation Calculation basis: The pension is calculated based on your years of service and your average salary over the last years. Accrual rate: 2% per year of service (pre-2012 members, max 35 years) or 1.85% per year (post-2012 members, max 37 years and 10 months). Maximum pension: The pension may not exceed your final basic salary. The maximum accrual is 70% for pre-2012 members (35 × 2%) or approximately 70% for post-2012 members. Survivor's pension: In case of death, your spouse and dependents may receive a survivor's pension. Disability pension: If you become permanently incapacitated, you may be entitled to a disability pension. Leaving CERN Options: The options available depend on your years of service. Review all alternatives carefully before deciding. Election deadline: You must communicate your choice within 3 months of departure. No retroactive changes are possible. Financial advice: It is highly recommended to obtain professional financial advice before making any pension decision. Tax implications: The tax implications of receiving a lump sum vs. a periodic pension can be very different depending on your country of residence. Practical Tips Check your pension estimate on the CERN HR portal regularly to plan your future. Consider years of service when planning career moves. The differences between 4 and 5 years, or between 9 and 10 years, are significant. Get professional financial advice before leaving CERN, especially if you have more than 5 years of service. Understand the implications of transfer value versus deferred pension before making a decision.

Plan to start the online modules as early as possible. Mandatory Safety Course Every person working at CERN must complete a general safety awareness course before accessing the sites. This course covers the essential topics you need to know to stay safe on CERN premises. Fire safety and evacuation procedures Electrical hazard awareness Radiation awareness fundamentals Emergency contacts and reporting The course has both an online component (e-learning) and an on-site component. You can begin the online portion before arriving at CERN, which is strongly recommended to speed up the registration process. Types of Safety Training Depending on your role and the areas you will work in, you may need one or more of the following training courses: General Safety (Level 1) &mdash; Mandatory for all personnel. Covers basic site safety, fire prevention, and evacuation. Radiation Protection (Level 2/3) &mdash; Required for work in accelerator tunnels or experimental areas. Level depends on exposure category. Electrical Safety &mdash; Required for anyone working on or near electrical installations. Cryogenics Safety &mdash; Needed if you work near cryogenic systems, especially around the LHC. Chemical Safety &mdash; For personnel handling chemical substances in laboratories. Working at Heights &mdash; Required for tasks involving ladders, scaffolding, or elevated platforms. E-Learning Platform CERN provides safety e-learning modules through the Learning Hub platform. These modules can be completed before your arrival, allowing you to begin work more quickly once on site. Access the Safety e-learning section on the CERN Learning Hub Mandatory modules are flagged clearly in your training profile Certificates are stored automatically in your profile upon completion You can track your progress and see upcoming deadlines On-Site Training Some safety courses include practical on-site sessions that cannot be replaced by e-learning. These sessions provide hands-on experience with safety equipment and procedures. Fire extinguisher handling practice Evacuation drills for your building Building-specific safety briefings from your safety officer Schedule practical sessions through your supervisor or the HSE unit Certification Renewal Safety certifications are not permanent. Most need to be renewed periodically to ensure your knowledge stays up to date. Most general certifications are valid for 3 to 5 years Radiation protection training typically requires renewal every 3 years The system sends you an automatic notification before your certification expires Re-certification usually involves retaking the e-learning module and, in some cases, the on-site session Specific Hazards at CERN CERN is a unique environment with hazards not found in typical workplaces. Be aware of the following: Radiation zones &mdash; CERN has supervised and controlled radiation areas. Access requires specific training and dosimetry equipment. Cryogenic risks &mdash; The LHC operates at extremely low temperatures. Cryogenic leaks can displace oxygen and cause cold burns. Electrical installations &mdash; High-voltage equipment is present in many areas. Only qualified personnel may work on these systems. Confined spaces &mdash; Some areas have restricted ventilation. Entry requires a permit and specific training. Overhead cranes &mdash; Heavy lifting equipment is used in experimental halls. Stay clear of marked zones during operations. Safety Rules on Site Wear your CERN badge visibly at all times while on site Follow all zone access restrictions &mdash; never enter areas you are not authorized for Report any incident or unsafe situation immediately to your safety officer Never enter the accelerator tunnel without explicit authorization Know the contact details of your building safety officer and the CERN Fire Brigade (phone 74444) References CERN HSE (Health, Safety &amp; Environment) CERN Safety E-Learning (Learning Hub) CERN Safety Rules Print this page"},{"title":"Access Cards at CERN - CERN Starter Pack","url":"/en/access-cards.html","content":"Access Cards at CERN - CERN Starter Pack Skip to main content Home / Technical Help / Access Cards Access Cards at CERN Last updated: February 2026 Your CERN access card is your primary identification on site. It must be worn visibly at all times and is required for entering buildings, gates, and restricted areas. CERN Access Card The CERN access card is issued during your registration at the Users Office. It serves as your ID badge and grants physical access to the CERN sites. The card is RFID-enabled and works with door readers and gate barriers across the campus. You must carry your access card at all times while on CERN premises. It is used not only for building access but also for identification purposes during security checks. Card Types Staff card (blue) &mdash; Issued to CERN staff members with employment contracts. User card (pink/red) &mdash; Issued to registered users, fellows, and associates. Contractor card &mdash; Issued to personnel from external companies working on CERN projects. Visitor card &mdash; Temporary card for short-term visitors, typically valid for a single day or event. The validity period of your card depends on your contract type. Staff cards are typically valid for the duration of the contract, while user cards may need periodic renewal. Getting Your Card Your access card is issued at the Users Office (Building 55) during your initial registration. You will need the following documents: Valid passport or national ID card Contract letter or appointment confirmation from CERN A passport-style photo (can be taken on site if needed) The process is typically completed on the same day. You will also undergo biometric registration (fingerprint) which is linked to your card for access to certain restricted areas. Building &amp; Zone Access Not all buildings at CERN have the same access level. Your card grants you access to general areas by default, but specific buildings and zones may require additional authorization. Request additional building access through the ADaMS system (Access and Safety at CERN) Your supervisor must approve access requests for restricted zones Accelerator tunnels and experimental caverns require specific safety training before access is granted Access rights are reviewed periodically and may be revoked if training expires Vehicle Access If you drive to CERN, you need a separate vehicle sticker in addition to your personal access card.

Always check the latest version of Operational Circular No. 7 (OC7) for the most current rules. Overview CERN's telework policy is governed by Operational Circular No. 7 (OC7). It establishes a hybrid working model that aims to balance on-site presence with flexibility for remote work. The policy recognizes that many tasks can be performed remotely while maintaining the collaborative environment that is essential for CERN's research mission. However, on-site presence remains important for teamwork, hands-on activities, and building professional relationships. Eligibility Telework is available to staff members and fellows with an active CERN contract Doctoral students should check with their supervisor regarding eligibility, as it may depend on the experiment or group Not all roles are eligible &mdash; positions requiring hands-on technical work, laboratory presence, or shift duties may not qualify New employees are generally recommended to work on-site initially to build relationships and learn procedures before starting telework The 40% Limit The maximum proportion of working time that can be spent teleworking is 40% , which typically translates to about 2 days per week for a full-time schedule. The 40% is calculated over a reference period, not on a strict weekly basis Your supervisor has discretion in how the schedule is organized Some weeks you may telework more and others less, as long as the average stays within the limit Part-time employees have the same 40% ratio applied to their contracted hours Approval Process To begin teleworking, you must submit a formal request through the official channels: Submit your telework request through EDH (Electronic Document Handling) Your direct supervisor must approve the request Your section leader or group leader provides endorsement Telework agreements are typically reviewed on an annual basis Location Requirements Where you telework from matters. There are important legal and administrative considerations regarding your telework location. You must telework from your country of residence (typically Switzerland or France) Working from a third country (outside CH/FR) requires special approval and is generally limited Extended work from another country may have tax implications &mdash; consult HR if in doubt Insurance coverage may be affected if you telework from an unapproved location Equipment &amp; Connectivity CERN provides the essential tools for remote work, but you are responsible for ensuring a suitable home working environment. CERN provides a laptop suitable for remote work VPN access through the CERN VPN client for secure connection to internal resources Zoom and Microsoft Teams are available for video meetings and collaboration You are responsible for your home internet connection Discuss any additional equipment needs (monitor, keyboard, etc.) with your supervisor Schedule &amp; Availability When teleworking, you are expected to maintain your regular availability and be reachable by your team.

You must remain enrolled at your home university throughout your doctoral work. Make sure you understand your university's requirements before starting at CERN. CERN &amp; Doctoral Students CERN does not award PhD degrees. Your doctorate is granted by your home university, and you must remain registered there throughout your time at CERN. CERN provides a world-class research environment, access to unique experimental facilities, and expert supervision for your doctoral research. You will typically have both a CERN supervisor (for day-to-day research guidance) and a university supervisor (for academic and thesis requirements). The typical duration for doctoral work at CERN is 3 to 4 years, depending on your university's programme and your research progress. Doctoral Student Programme The CERN Doctoral Student programme is the main channel for PhD students to work at CERN. It is open to students enrolled in a doctoral programme at a university in a CERN Member or Associate Member State. Eligibility: You must be enrolled in a PhD programme, have a university supervisor, and your research topic must align with CERN's scientific activities. There are typically two application rounds per year. Contract: Doctoral students receive a limited-duration contract (usually up to 3 years). The contract includes a monthly stipend, travel allowance, and health insurance (CHIS). Stipend: The monthly stipend covers living expenses in the Geneva area. The exact amount is reviewed periodically. A travel allowance for one return trip per year to your home institution is also provided. Thesis at CERN Your thesis is submitted to and evaluated by your home university, following their academic procedures and requirements. CERN does not grant the degree. CERN supervisor role: Your CERN supervisor provides day-to-day research guidance, helps you navigate the CERN environment, and typically serves on your thesis committee or as an external reviewer. Thesis committee: You may have a thesis committee with members from both CERN and your university. Regular progress reviews are common practice. CERN-THESIS registration: All theses based on work done at CERN must be registered in the CERN Document Server (CDS) under the CERN-THESIS collection. This ensures your work is archived and accessible. CERN requires open access publication of your thesis. Hyper-Authorship Large experimental collaborations at CERN (such as ATLAS, CMS, ALICE, and LHCb) publish papers with author lists of 3,000 or more physicists. This is known as hyper-authorship. If you are a member of one of these collaborations, you will appear as an author on all papers published by the collaboration during your membership period, regardless of your direct involvement in each analysis. Implications for your CV: Hyper-authored papers demonstrate collaboration membership but may not clearly show your individual contribution. Highlight your specific analysis contributions separately on your CV. Single-author thesis papers: Your thesis itself and any single-author or small-group papers you publish are important for demonstrating your individual research capability. Discuss publication strategy with your supervisors early. Practical Matters Contract duration: Doctoral student contracts are typically for up to 3 years. Extensions may be possible in exceptional cases but are not guaranteed. Social security: As a CERN doctoral student, you are covered by the CERN social security scheme. This includes pension contributions and insurance coverage during your contract. Health insurance: You are enrolled in CHIS (CERN Health Insurance Scheme). See the health insurance page on this site for details about coverage and the droit d'option if you live in France. Accommodation: CERN hostel rooms may be available for your initial weeks. After that, you will need to find private housing. The CERN Housing Service can help with your search. Travel budget: A travel allowance is provided for attending conferences, workshops, and visits to your home university. Discuss your travel plan with your supervisor and the relevant CERN department. Computing &amp; Resources CERN computing account: You will receive a CERN computing account upon arrival. This gives you access to email, the CERN network, and all central computing services. lxplus: The lxplus interactive login service provides access to a shared Linux computing cluster for analysis work. Connect via SSH using your CERN credentials. EOS storage: EOS is CERN's large-scale storage system. You will have personal and project storage space for your data and analysis files. CERN GitLab: Use CERN's GitLab instance for version control and code collaboration. Most experiments and groups maintain their software repositories there. Indico &amp; Mattermost: Indico is used for scheduling meetings, conferences, and events. Mattermost is CERN's internal messaging platform for team communication. After Your PhD CERN fellowships: After completing your PhD, you can apply for CERN Research or Applied fellowships. These are competitive positions lasting 1-3 years. Postdoc options: Many former CERN doctoral students continue in postdoctoral positions at CERN, at other laboratories, or at universities worldwide. Leaving CERN: When your contract ends, you must complete the CERN departure procedure, which includes returning equipment, settling accounts, and obtaining clearance from various services. Alumni network: CERN has an active alumni network. Stay connected for career opportunities, events, and to maintain your professional network in high-energy physics and beyond. Tips Maintain close contact with your home university: Regular communication with your university supervisor and department is essential. Do not let the physical distance create an academic gap. Attend CERN Academic Training: CERN offers an extensive academic training programme with lectures and courses. These are excellent for broadening your knowledge and meeting researchers from other fields. Network at workshops and conferences: Take advantage of CERN's central position in the physics community. Attend workshops, present your work, and build your professional network early. Plan your thesis writing timeline early: Do not leave thesis writing to the last months. Start structuring your thesis and writing chapters well in advance of your expected submission date.
